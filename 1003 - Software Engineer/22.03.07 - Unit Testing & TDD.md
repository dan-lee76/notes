## White Block testing
- You know the code is supposed to work
- You tests test for how it is supposed to work

## Black Box testing
- Where tester doesn't know how the code works
- Just know what is supposed to output for an input
- For release testing and user acceptance testing

## Automated
- Large amounts of scripts or coded tests
- May automate large volume data testing
- Run as often the code is complied
- Built into control platform

## Manual
- Higher level
- Usually run at planned times - end of key stages
- Can act as a progress gate-keeping activity
- Usually run on version of code that is 'ready' to test

# Test Driven Development
- Take spec and start writing tests for a class
- Auto tests every time run code
- Whitebox testing

## Advantages
- Integrates aspects of Specification, Coding and Testing
- Makes you think how code is used before being built
- Means you plan and get the bigger picture
- Also makes you know where the code failed based on the tests

# JUnit
- Framework for writing tests for java code
- Its added to the project
- Has special commands to make testing easier

Can write `@BeforeAll{}` functions. This does something before the test, like create text files for the test
Also have `@AfterAll` to delete those text files
Can use this to create bad and good data
Also have `@BeforeEach` and `@AfterEach`

## Other Asserts
`void assertTrue(boolean condition) `- Check that a condition is true.
`void assertFalse(boolean condition)` - Check that a condition is false e.g. `assertFalse(x > 12)`
`void assertNotNull(Object object)` - Check that an object isn't null.
`void assertNull(Object object)` - Check that an object is null
`void assertSame(boolean condition)` - Check that two objects are the
same (when equals wont work in java)
`void assertNotSame(boolean condition)` - Check they are not

 # Good & Bad Tests
 Write the tests first. Need to run the test to make sure it fails
 
 ## Good Tests
 - **Line Coverage**: Has every line of code been tested
 - **Function Coverage** - Has every function been tested
 - **Condition Coverage** - Has each evaluation point been tested
 - **Path Coverage** - Has every possible route through the code been tested
 - **Entry/Exit coverage** - has every call/return option been tested
- Should never have to edit a test

# Maintainable Code
Allows you to quickly and easily:
- Fix a bug, without introducing a new bug as you do so
- Add new features, without introducing bugs as you do so
- Improve Usability
- Increase performance
- Make a fix that prevents a bug from occurring in future
- Make changes to support new environments, operating systems or tools
- Bring new developers on board your project

Need to make the code understandable, so add comments and make it easy to understand
Making code maintainable is especially useful in open source as can get over people to fix issues and the project can keep going on 

Have code review to ensure its understandable and there are no errors.
Code reviews and pair programming are good uses to help maintainability. Only use them where errors are prone and highest impact on successful function

- Need to be able to understand the code after programming it (after few months)
- Make sure the code is easy to change
- Easy to verify a change
- Can you make a change with only a low risk of breaking existing features, if it does break is it easy to fix?

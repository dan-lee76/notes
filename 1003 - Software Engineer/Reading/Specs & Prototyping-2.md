# How to write good specs
As a specs writer need to trick people into reading your stuff, and not make someone with small brains to leak out through eye-sockets.

Four Rules:
1. Be funny
	- Best place is inside the examples section
	- If don't think you can be funny due to 'professionalism', then change job 
2. Writing a spec is like writing code for a brain to execute
	- Ask yourself if the person reading the spec will understand it at a deep level. 
3. Write as simply as possible
	- Use the most simple language possible, even if it doesn't seem professional
	- Use big fonts and don't make the page seem full of words, add loads of white space and vary the fonts.
	- Screenshots are a must! 
4. Review and reread several times
	- When you find a sentence that isn't super easy to understand, rewrite it.
5. Templates considered harmful
	- Don't have sections on templates which aren't an important for every feature
	- Want people to read. Drop the idea of a template

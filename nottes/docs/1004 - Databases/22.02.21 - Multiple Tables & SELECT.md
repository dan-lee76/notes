# SQL Select
```SQL
SELECT
 [DISTINCT | ALL] column-list
	FROM table-names
	[WHERE condition]
	[ORDER BY column-list]
	[GROUP BY column-list]
	[HAVING condition]
```

## DISTINCT and ALL
- Using `DISTINCT` removes duplicates
- Using `ALL` retains duplicates
- `ALL` is used as a default if neither is supplied
- Can work over multiple columns

## WHERE Clauses
- Restricts rows that are returned
- Takes the form of a condition - only rows that satisfy the condition are returned

## SELECT
- Combine information from two or more tables
- If columns have same name, can be resolved by using `TableName.ColumnName` (Resolves ambiguity)

# Subqueries
A `SELECT` statement can be nested inside another query to form a subquery.
The result of the subquery are passed back to the containing query
- Often will return a set of values rather than a single value
- Cannot directly compare a single value to a set. Doing so will result in an error
- Options for handling sets:
	- `IN`
	- `EXISTS`
	- `ALL/ANY`
	- `NOT`

## IN
- Using `IN` can see if a given value is in a set of values
- `NOT IN `checks to see if a given value is not in the set
- The set can be given explicitly or can be produced in a subquery

## Aliases
Aliases rename columns or tables
- Can make names more meaningful
- Can shorten names, making them easier to use
- Can resolve ambiguous names

EXISTS - Can see whether there is at least one element in a given set
ANY and ALL - Compare a single value to a set of values

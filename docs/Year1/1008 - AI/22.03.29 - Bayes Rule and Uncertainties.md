## Knowledge Based Systems
To consider decisions we must introduce methods that can cope with uncertainty

## Probability
Basic statistical methods deal with uncertainty via probability

**Probability = (number of desired outcomes)/ (total number of outcomes)**


## Bayes Rule
The fundamental notion of Bayesian Statistics is that of conditional probability 
$$P(H|E)$$
The probability of a Hypothesis (H) being true based on evidence (E)

$$P(H|E)=\frac{P(E|H)*P(H)}{P(E)}$$

- $P(H|E)$ - Probability that hypothesis is true given evidence
- $P(E|H)$ - Probability that we will observe evidence given that hypothesis is true
- $P(H)$ - That *a priori* probability that hypothesis is true in the absence of any specific evidence
- $P(E)$ - Probability of observing *E* in the absence of any specific hypothesis

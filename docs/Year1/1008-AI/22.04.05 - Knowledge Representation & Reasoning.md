# Knowledge Based Systems
- Humans use not only methods, but also domain specific knowledge, in problem solving.
- Top down approach

A system which is built around a knowledge base (not like a database) i.e. a collection of knowledge, taken from a human, and stored in such a way that the system can reason with it
- Substitute, the certain extend, the experts.
- Make good decisions, quickly, to come with problems
- Domain specific: a narrow range of knowledge

1. **Acquire Knowledge** - Transfer expertise from knowledge source to a program
2. **Represent knowledge** - Symbolic encoding of propositions
3. **Apply the knowledge (reasoning)** - Deduce logical consequences: to produce *new* propositions.

## Knowledge acquisition/engineering
- Knowledge Engineering: Design, build, install a knowledge based system
- Also called **knowledge acquisition**

### Bottlenecks
- Human knowledge is complex and unstructured
- Expert is often too close to the problem under consideration, difficult in seeing it objectively
- Situation is worse when the knowledge source comprises of several experts

## Stages
1. Define task
2. Build domain Vocabulary (words, phrases, formulae)
3. Develop a Model of the reasoning and how it is applied (paper exercises, flowcharts etc)

# Knowledge Representation
Problems with natural language: Often ambiguous, syntax and semantics not fully understood.

**Predicate Logic**: Formal language to represent knowledge
- Symbolic AI: Expressive, powerful to derive new knowledge from old, through mathematical deduction

**Inference**: infer conclusions from known statements.

## Resolution Rule
**Resolution Rule**: An inference method. *For automated theorem proving*, *Proves new terms by contradictions*

Input: a knowledge base and a statement
1. Transfer knowledge base into Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF)
	- CNF: Propositions represented as a conjunction of clauses 
2. Negate the statement, add it to the knowledge base
3. Unification: replace variables by a concrete instance (constant)
4. Resolution: if a contradiction exists then the negated statement is false (applied repeatedly)
5. Therefore, the original statement **must be true**

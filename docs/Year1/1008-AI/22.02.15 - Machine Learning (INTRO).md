## Machine Learning: definition
Program said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of task T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T, as measure by P, improved with experience E. Let the program learn by themselves

## Data
1. Models and algorithms
	- Doesn't require knowledge engineers
2. Powerful and cheaper computation
3. Massive data warehouse

## Process
Partition the total dataset into subsets:
- Learning the parameters of the model
- How to generalise to independent data (issue of overfitting). Unbiased estimate of how well the model works
- Over fitting - When a statistical model fits exactly against its training data. When this happens the algorithm cannot perform accurately against unseen data

### Evaluation of models
- 70% training, 30% testing
- Multiple runs using different partitions i.e K-fold cross-validation

## Data Mining
Exploration and analysis of large quantities of data to discover valid, novel, useful and understandable patterns in data
- Valid: Hold on new data with some certainty
- Novel: non-obvious to the system
- Useful: should be possible to act on the item
- Understandable: humans should be able to interpret the patter/model

Machine Learning: predicts with models
Data mining: explains patterns

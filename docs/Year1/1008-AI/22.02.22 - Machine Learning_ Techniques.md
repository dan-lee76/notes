## Types of Tasks
Supervised Learning - Function from labelled training data, each example consisting of an input and a desired output (Classifications, regression)

Unsupervised Learning - Function to describe hidden structure from unlabelled data. There is basically no output

Classification - Learn to predict to which set a instance belongs to based on pre-labeled (classified) instances
Supervised learning, many approaches: regression, decision trees, neural networks

## Supervised Learning
### Regression
Estimated relationship between variable Y and variable(s) X
Function: Based on the given data to minimise its mean squared error (MSE) to 'fit' the data

### Decision Tree
Internal Nodes: decision rules on features (decision variables, input)
Leaf Nodes: a predicted class label(output)
|Pros|Cons|
|----|----|
|Reasonable training time| Only simple decision boundaries|
|Handle large features|Problem with lots of missing data|
|Easy to implement|Cannot handle complicated relationship|
|Easy to interpret| 

### Neural Networks
Set of neurons connected by directed weighted edges
|Pros|Cons|
|----|----|
|Cam learn more complicated class boundaries|Hard to implement|
|Can be more accurate| Slow training time|
|Can handle large number of features|Can over fit the data|
| |Hard to interpret|

## Supervised Learning: Applications
### Clustering
- Given: Un-labeled data set D and Similarity/distance metric
- Goal: Find 'natural' partitioning, or groups of similar data points
- Application: Divide a market into distinct subsets of customers

### Association Rules
Discover correlation between any two or more variables
- Given: Set of records containing items
- Goal: Produce dependency rules, to predict occurrence of one variable based on occurrences of another variable
- Application: Market basket analysis

Correlation $\ne$ Causation

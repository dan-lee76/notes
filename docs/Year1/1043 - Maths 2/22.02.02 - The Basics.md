# 1. The Basics
## Basic Definitions and notation
Set is a collection of items, name elements, characterised by a certain property
$A = \{ 2,4,7,D,24\}$
Element $x$ belgons to $A$ indicated as $x \in A$
Several elements of $A$ compose a *subset* $S:S\subset A$

Want to inidcate all the elements of the set:
$\forall x \in A:$
Want to say there exists(at least) one element of $A$ which has a certain property (such that):
$\exists x \in A \ni '$  
Want to say there exists only/exactly one element of $A$ which has certain property
$\exists! x \in A \ni '$
if statement 1 THEN statement 2
$\rightarrow$
statement 1 IF AND ONLY IF statement 2
$\iff$
## Cardinality of a set
*coincident* - every element of $A$ is also an element of $B$ and every element of $B$ is also an element of $A$
*cardinality* of a set is *number* of elements contained in $A$
*empty* - indicated with $\emptyset$

## Intersection and Union
*intersection* - $C = A \cap B$ - set containing all the elements that are both in the sets $A$ and $B$
*union* - $C = A \cup B$ - set containing all the elements that are either or both the sets $A$ and $B$
*difference* - $C = A \setminus B$ - set containing all the elements that are in $A$ but not $B$

## Associativity of the Intersection
$(A\cap B) \cap C = A\cap (B\cap C)$
## Numbers and Number sets
Set is *finite* if its cardinality is a finite number. Set is *infinite* if its cardinality is $\infty$
*continuous* if $\forall x_0 \in A:\exists x \ni ' |x-x_0|$

## Types of Number Sets
*Continue from last semester*
â„‚ - Set of number than can be expressed as $a+jb$ where $a,b\in \R$ and the imaginary uni $j=\sqrt {-1}$

## Cartesian Product
New set generated by all the possible pairs
$C=A\times B$
$A=\{ 1,5,7\}$
$B=\{ 2,3\}$
$C=A\times B = \{ (1,2),(1,3),(5,2),(5,3),(7,2),(7,3)\}$
## Relations
### Order Relation
Indicated with $\preceq$ if following properties are verified:
- reflexivity
- transitivity
- antisymmetry
#### Example
Let $x,y \in \N$ and let consider $(x,y) \in \mathscr{R}$ if and only if $x$ is a multiple of $y$. More formally
$(x,y)\in \mathscr{R}\iff \frac{x}{y} = k$ with $k\in \N$
### Equivalence
Indicated with $\equiv$ if following properties are verified:
- Reflexivity - $x \equiv x$
- symmetry - $x\equiv y$ then $y\equiv x$ 
- transitivity - $x\equiv y$ and $y\equiv x$ then $x \equiv z$
### Equivalence Classes
Let $\mathscr{R}$ be an equivalence relation defined on $A$. The *equivalence class* of an element $a$ is a set defined as 
$[a]=\{ x \in A|x \equiv a \}$ 
### Partition
Set of all the elements equivalent to $a \in A$ is called equivalence class and is indicated with $[a]$
## Functions/Mapping
Relation is to be a *mapping* or *function* when it relates to any element of a set unique element of another. Let $A$ and $B$ be two sets, a mapping $f:A \to B$ is a relation  $\mathscr{R} \subseteq A\times B$ such that:
$\forall x \in A\exists! y \in B\ni '(x,y) \in \mathscr{R}$
(Every element, find only 1 element in other set such that y is = x)

The statement $(x,y) \in \mathscr{R}$ can be expressed also as $y=f(x)$
*Unary operator* - $f:A \to B$
*Binary operator* - $f:A \times A \to B$ or $f:A\times C\to B$
*Internal composition law* - $f:A\times A\to A$

*algebraic structure* - set endowed with 1+ internal composition laws
$(A,+,.)$

### Injective Functions
$f A \to B$ is injection if the function values of two different elements is always different: $\forall x_1$ and $\forall x_2$ if $x_1 \ne x_2$ then $f(x_1) \ne f(x_2)$
Never crosses horizontal line twice. Doesnt cross it twice
### Surjective Functions
$f A \to B$ is surjective if all elements of $B$ are mapped by an element of $A: \forall y\in B$ it follows that $\exists x \in A$ such that $y=f(x)$
Graph has no holes. Y axis as got a function, eg crosses graph
### Bijective Functions
$f A \to B$ is bijective when both injection and surjection are verified

# Basic Definitions of Mappings
## Mapping and Domain
$U$ be a set such that $U\subseteq E$
The relation $f$ is said *mapping* when 
$$\forall u\in U : \exists!w\in F \ni`f(u)=w$$
Said domain and is indicated with $dom(f)$

A vector $w$ such that
$$w=f(u)$$
is said to be the mapped (or transformed) of $u$ through $f$

## Image
Image ($Im$) is a set of all all vectors $w$ that exist such that $f(u)=w$
$$Im(f)=\{w\in F | \exist u\in E\ni`f(u)=w\}$$

dom/domain = Input
Image = output $\to$ also means a subset

## Surjective, injective, bijective
Mapping $f$ is **surjective** if the image of $f$ coincides with $F:Im(f)=F$

Mapping $f$ is **injective** if $\forall u,v \in E$ with $f(u)=f(v)\to u=v$
(if $u$ is different from $v$, then so will $f(u)/f(v)$)

Mapping $f$ is **bijective** if $f$ is **injective** and **surjective**

# Linear Mappings
## Linear Mapping
Linear mapping if the following properties are valid:
- Additivity: $\forall u,v \exists E:f(u+v)=f(u)+f(v)$
- Homogeneity: $\forall\lambda \in K$ and $\forall v\in E :f(\lambda v)= \lambda f(v)$

(This happens very very rarely)
## Affine Mapping
Said **affine** if 
$ g(v) = f(v) - f(u)$ is linear
## Linear Mappings
Image of $U$ through $f$, $f(U)$ is the set 
$$f(U)=\{w\in F | \exist u \in U \ni`f(u)=w\}$$
Follows that the triple $(f(u),+,.)$ is a vectors subspace of $(F,+,.)$
## Inverse Image
$$E\to W\subset F$$
The inverse image of $W$ through $f$, indicated with $f^{-1}(w)$ is a set defined as:
$$f^{-1}w=\{u\in E|f(u)\in W\}$$
## Matrix Representation
Linear mapping can be expressed as the product of a matrix by a vector $y=f(x)=Ax$
## Image from a matrix
The mapping $y=f(x)$ is expressed as a matrix equation $y=Ax$. Follows that the image of the mapping $Im(f)$ is spanned by the column vectors of the matrix
A:
$$Im(f)=L(a^1,a^2,...a^n)$$
where
$$A=(a^1,a^2,...a^n)$$

(Just convert matrix into (A). Columns into own (C))
# Endomorphisms and Kernel
## Endomorphism 
$E\to F$. If $E=F$, $f:E\to E$ then linear mapping is *endomorphism*
## Null Mapping
$O:E \to F$ is a mapping defined as $\forall v \in E: O(v) = O_F$
## Identity Mapping
(Should be same dimension)
$I:E\to F$ is a mapping defined as $\forall v\in E: I(v)=v$
## Matrix Representation
$E\to E$ be endomorphism.
Mapping of multiplication of a square matrix by a vector: $f(x):Ax$

$y=f(X)=Ax$. The inverse function $x=f^{-1}(y)=A^{-1}y$
## Linear dependence 
Needs to be endomorphism
$v_1...$ likely dependent then so are $f(v)...$
## Kernal 
$E\to F$ linear mapping
$$ker(f)=\{v\in E| f(v) = o_F$$
### Kernal as Vector Space
The triple $(Ker(f),+,.)$ is a vector subspace of $(E,+,.)$
### Kernal and Injection
$f:E\to F$ be a linear mapping $u,v\in E$. Follows that 
$$f(u)=f(v)$$
if and only if
$$u-v\in Ker(f)$$

#### Theorem
Mapping is injective if and only if:
$$Ker(f)=\{o_e\}$$

## Linear Independence and injection
$E\to F$
$V_1.....$ be $n$ linearly independent vectors $\in E$. If $f$ is injective then $f(v_1)...$ are also linearly independent vectors of $f$
Endomorphism $f$ is invertible if and only if it is injective

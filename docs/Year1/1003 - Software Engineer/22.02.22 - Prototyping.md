# 22.02.22 - Prototyping
## What are prototypes
Specifications are:
- Good for a checklist of things to achieve
- Hard to understand the overall idea
- Often full of conflicting specificaitons
- Bad for conveying the overall idea

Prototypes are:
- Way of envisioning how all your specifications work together
- A way of testing the consistency of your specifications
- Easy to show people and talk about

A concrete but partial representation of a system or partial implementation of a system
Prototyping are using extensively in most design and construction domains

## Low vs High Fidelity
|Low|High|
|---|---|
|Sketches/ 'paper' prototypes|Built in software for automation|
|produced quickly, thrown away|Finalises chose ideas, still thrown away|
|Generates many possible ideas, helps clients acceptance| Realistic studies, helps client acceptance|

Low-fidelity - Captures the point, the functions. Helps envisage the idea
High-fidelity - Represents part of the reality, to agree on the final designs.

## What are you prototyping?
### 3 types of prototyping
1. Role of technology
2. Look and Feel
3. Implementation guide

UI designers do #2
PowerPoint/paper do more #1

Prototypes help everyone to imagine whats being built, still need to be able to tell the developer. Sometimes code them up, but partial implementations

## Prototyping Risks
1. Investing too much on high-fidelity
2. Adhoc prototyping code is re-use in the real system
3. Prototyping is used instead of, rather than alongside, documentation
4. Prototypes might be approved by the wrong stakeholders

# User Stories
Have a list of actors - with 'representations' as personas
Have use cases - functions they will do
Now bring them together and add the why to it

>As a *role*, I want *goal/desire* so that *outcome*

Highly common in Agile Teams.
Single sentence - to represent a single requirement
- **a role** (actor/stakeholder etc)
- **goal**/function/action/use case
- an effect/**outcome**/motivation - the WHY behind the WHAT


| Pros                                 | Cons                                      |
|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Concise and Clear                    | Difficult to use in BIG projects          |
| Little maintenance                   | Loose detail and formality                |
| Creates clear requirements checklist | Done describe process or tasks or context |
| Breaks down project into chunks and can rank for importance|											 	|

# Documenting Requirements
## Requirement vs Specification
Requirement - What a stakeholder needs to be able to do
Specification - What the software must do to meet the requirement above

## Functional vs Non-Function

|Functional						| Non-Function					|
|--------------------|---------------------|
|Functions the user to achieve something (requirements) | Constraints on what the user needs to do (requirements)|
|Functions the software will include (specification)		| Constraints on how well the system performs (specifications) |

*Functional requirement has should in it*
# Investigating/Validating Requirements
## Investigation Techniques
All about the questions you ask
Its rarely enough to accept the initial answer to a question because that should highlight more things to ask about

Use the initial questions you had from the brief
- to set investigation goals, choose a technique to best learn about these things

## Surveys
Good for contacting lots of people, getting a majority view
Bad for actually understanding something in detail

Top Mistakes:
- Sending a badly made questionnaire
	- Can be designed well to extract a good answer
- Reinvent the wheel
	- Well tested proven surveys can use
	- Perceived Ease of Use Scale, usability questionnaires etc
- 2 part questions, leading questions, surveys are too long

## Interviews and Focus Groups
Gives you the freedom to ask follow up questions
- Strong interviews have 2 characteristics
	- Open minded, unbiased, ready to listen
	- Gets interviewee to be relaxed and chatty and involved
 - Get people to do more than just talk
- Must have a plan for the interview, otherwise it will fall through
### Interviews vs Focus Group
|Pros								|Cons							|
|------------------|-----------------|
|More people at once| Possible Conflict|
|Faster coverage of users| Can get a 'dominant speaker'|
|Discuss differences| Takes longer to discuss per Q|

Ideally 2 organisers so one can note take

## Observations
Allows you to see the things people didn't say 
People are not good at realising everything that's important for you to know

## Technology Tours
Helps you identify what things 'your new software' will work with 
The kind of setup and scenario it will be used with, e.g. on a whiteboard

## Ethnography
No better way to learn than doing
Targeting specific tasks, or roles in the company.

## Overall Strategy
Most mistakes are because people don't have a strategy
One method can help understand the results of another

If system shall do this, its a requirement

# Summary
**Requirement**: What a stakeholder needs to be able to do
**Specification**: What the software must do to meet the requirement above
**Functional**: What it will make user achieve(Req)/Functions the software will include (Spec)
**Non-functional**: What the user needs to do(Req)/How well the system performs (Spec)

# Requirements Change Mangement
## What is change management
**Change Management** is a systematic approach towards dealing with a change. It involves coordinating resources, applying tools and managing knowledge in order to effectively drive organisational success.
## Why is change management important
- **Operational excellence** - Doing the right thing in accordance with the business strategy
- **Management of risk** - If the process assessed doesn't bring any business value to the company, then the risk shouldn't be taken
- **Overall strategy** - Change has to support the overall strategy. Change manager has to understand the direction of the business is going, and if the change needs to be implemented or added to the skip list.
## Establishing a framework to manage the change process
Dont have to be challenging, expensive or process-heavy. If you take a framework approach, can quickly reduce incidents. 
### Identify the change type
CAB - Change advisory board
#### Standard Changes
Service or IT infrastructure. The risk and implementation process are known upfront.
#### Urgent Changes
Crisis or opportunity that should be addressed as soon as possible. Need to get specific approvals and authorisation from stakeholders. Similar to normal changes but at an accelerated timescale.
#### Normal Changes
Common, require unique and novel approaches. These changes have to go through a change process before they can be approved and implemented.
### Discuss and Prioritise the Changes
Sometimes organisation or customer cant accept too much change. Don't have the time or energy.
### Review the Current Workload and Organisational Structure
Developers are the key to delivering and supporting the change, need to have them on board. Dont have to be compliant, but believe in it so they can do their best work.
### Review and Communicate the Risks to the Stakeholders
Coordinate and collaborate across the organisation when change management is taking place. Want to ensure stakeholders are aware and know the risks. Not communicating can lead to incident and overall disruptions to the business at the end of the day.
### Incorporate Testing of Changes to Avoid Incidents
Deploy in stages with a fair amount of testing to avoid incidents. Apply to internal production environment then region specific.
### Use the Right Tools to Track Changes and Collect Data
Change management tools offer a structure for the often chaotic process of changes. They can also replace the unnecessary six-layer approval process and weeks of back-and-forth with compliance approval boards.
### Review, Analyse and Improve the Process
After implementation, should discuss how the change went, and discuss any bottlenecks and see how they can be improved.

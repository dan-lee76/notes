# 22.03.14 - Config Development
1. Version control
2. Continuous Integration
3. Build Configurations
4. Automatic Deployment

## Version Control
- From git can pull old versions of code. Can create a branch which represents v2.5
- Many strategies for using version control, manage versions and to see the expected reading
- Have different ways of branching, can branch for release, maintenance, feature, team. All depends on the company
- Need to always have a safe version in working mainline, don't want to damage it. Instead work on a branch off these mainlines
- Only once everything passes tests in branch, can then merge it into mainline
- Only head developers have access to modify the main branch, so no damage gets pushed. Someone always has the responsibility to protecting the mainline.
## Continuous Integration
Code changes go directly into mainline of version control
- automatically builds complete software as submitted, release-tests all new contributions
- successful build == accepted submission.
- Always have a working mainline in version control
- Have automatic build scripts to deploy them

Benefits:
- Supports TDD - all submissions need to integrate successfully
- Integration [and testing] is figured out form the start
- Identifies bugs quickly because integration happens sooner 

## Build Configurations
Configuration for a new version includes:
- Versions of components are included
- Which platform-specific libraries to bundle in
- Which test suite to perform
- Where to deploy the build

A release is then built based on the configuration, several versions can be created for different platforms

Companies are always refining build configs and scripts
## Automatic Deployment

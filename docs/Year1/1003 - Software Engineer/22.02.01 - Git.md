# 22.02.01 - Git
When using `git pull` sees if there is a difference between the server and local copy
Have an official source on server and a working copy

- Keep a history of everything
- Designed to stop multiple people overwriting changes by mistake
- Lets you work on copies (branches)

`git add` - move file to the main code folder
`git commit` - commit into the main code folder
`git log` - See history of code, can see it at any time, step backwards to a previous commit. 
	- Can roll back an entire git folder
	- Can extract a single file out of an old commit
	
`git tag` - Gives friendly name to a commit. Can be a working version that is ready for release

Multiple people have their own copy, `git push` updates to server.
	- Git will handle anything thats easy, easy when someone else has edited a different bit of the same file
	- When it cant - itll ask you to do it 'intelligently'
	
`git pull` - brings down the latest version. Should do it before coding, andbefore pushing to see if there is any changes
`git diff` - show you the difference between the two files
`git stash` - stores everything in process, can then pop it out later. Keeps it secure
`.gitignore` - ignore files to push

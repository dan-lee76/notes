# Specifications (vs Requirements)
User requirements : Client managers, contractor managers
System Specification: Software developments
# What specifications are like
- Focus on WHAT should be built - but not  necessarily how
- Specifying: What a system will do to meet the user requirements
- Specifications should be tied to a requirement

## Specs - Natural Language
- Can be expensive, intuitive and universal, but may be ambiguous, vague and interpreted differently.
- Guidelines
	1. Use a standard format
	2. Distinguish between mandatory and desirable
	3. Emphasis important elements with **bold**, *italic*
	4. Avoid jargon, unless clearly specified in a key words section
	5. **make sure the specification is measurable** is some form

## Specs - Structured
Go further than natural language specifications, to tabulate specifications, or put them in templates
Can be used to specify additional information

## Specs - Graphical
UML Models, diagrams, prototypes.
Often easier to see a UML sequence diagram
When complex, visualise them

# Good specification
Analysing the quality of specifications is also important
Good quality specifications have a few qualities

## Specs - Traceability
All specifications can be traced to user requirements. In reports, should for every specification.
To have implemented a single spec, want to know you achieved what is specified

## Specification reviews
Formal review process
Each person takes a  - to systematically review the specifications:
- Validity checks
- Consistency checks
- Completeness checks
- Realism checks
- Verifiability checks

# What [else] happens to specs
Go onto prototypes. 
### Prototype combines
- The graphical specs - UML models
- Textual spec

To demonstrate how they might work together in a system
Like specs help to validate requirements

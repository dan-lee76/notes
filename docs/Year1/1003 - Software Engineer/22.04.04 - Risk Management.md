# Software Risks
## Risk Requirements for Software
Requirements & Specs were all about 'should' and 'shall'
## Shall Not requirements
### Functional Requirements
- What should not happen
- What should happen for non-correct usage or errors
- E.g. putting negative number shouldn't give them money back
### Non-functional requirements
- Define the reliability and availability of software
- Saying software shouldn't break at 20,000 then software shouldn't break at anything less
## Risk Decomposition
- Might be several ways that a risk can occur
- Sometimes best solution to solve a problem, not the best for that problem but the best for all related problems
- If you collect shall-not specifications: can make it part of your collective design decisions
## Risk reduction
1) Hazard Avoidance - so it cannot occur
2) Hazard Detection & Removal - so systems recover nicely
3) Damage Limitation - so the impact is limited

These are design issues that might affect at the start
## Risk-based release tests
- Test plan might be driven by these
- Might dictate choice of hardware, or database software
- Might mean designing to optimise/minimise use of those
## Security Concerns
Also security related issues, what were the most valuable parts of system which people want to get hold of. 
- Identify possible routes to this information
- Especially relevant for APIs, which purposefully give access

# Project Risks
## Concerns
1. Deliver the software to the customer on schedule
2. Keep overall costs within budget
3. Deliver software that means the customers expectations
4. Maintain a happy and well-functioning dev team

## Risk Analysis
- Most important jobs for a project manager: 
	- Considering and preparing for possible problems in the future
	- For the project going smoothly
- All risks should be listed, and a strategy considered
## Risk types
- Technology
- People
- Organisational
- Tools
- Requirements
- Estimation
## Risk Prioritisation
Probability of it:
- very low (<10%)
- low (10-25%)
- moderate (25-50%)
- high (50-75%)
- very high (>75%)
The effect of it:
- catastrophic (project fail)
- serious (expense/delays)
- tolerable (in contingency)
- insignificant (don't care)
## Risk Planning
- **Avoidance strategies** - actions taken to reduce the risk happening. Best one to have (backups)
- **Minimisation strategies** - reducing the impact if it happens
- **Contingency plans** - what you will do/change if it happens
## Risk Monitoring
Still need to monitor the risk, even after planning
Need to check to see if any of the following appear to be happening
| Risk Type      | Potential Indicators                                                                                           |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Technology     | Late delivery of hardware or support software; many reported technology problems.                              |
| People         | Poor staff morale; poor relationships amongst team members; high staff turnover.                               |
| Organisational | Organizational gossip; lack of action by senior management.                                                    |
| Tools          | Reluctance by team members to use tools; complaints about CASE tools; demands for higher-powered workstations. |
| Requirements   | Many requirements change requests; customer complaints.                                                        |
| Estimation     | Failure to meet agreed schedule; failure to clear reported defects.                                            |

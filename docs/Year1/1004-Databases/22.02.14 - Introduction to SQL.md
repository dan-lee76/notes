# 22.02.14 - SQL
## SQL
SQL is a language based on the relational model
- Implementation is provided by a DBMS
## SQL Case
Written in BOLD COURIER FONT
SQL keywords are not case-sensitive
Table names, column names are case sensitive
ANSI standard for strings are single quotes


| Relations | E/R Diagrams | SQL |
|-----------|--------------|-----|
| Relation | Entity | Table |
| Tuple | Instance | Row |
| Attribute | Attribute | Column or field |
| Foreign Key | M:1 Relationship | Foreign Key |
| Primary Key | Attribute | Primary Key |

## Implementing E/R Diagrams
- Entities become SQL tables
- Attributes of an entry become columns
- Can approximate the domains of the attributes by assigning types to each column
- Relationships may be represented by foreign keys

## Relationships
Represented in SQL using Foreign Keys
- 1:1 are not used, or can be treated as a special case of M:1
- M:1 are represented as a foreign key from the M-side to the 1
- M:M are split into two M:1 relationships

## Foreign Keys
Defined as constraints, need to provide:
- Columns which make up the foreign key
- The reference table
- The columns which are referenced by the foreign key

## Primary Keys
Defined through a constraint
Automatically adds UNIQUE and NOT NULL to relevant column definition

## Storage Engines
- Can specify the engine used to store files onto disk
- Type of storage engine will have a large effect on the operation of the database
- Engine should be specified when a table is created
Storage Engines:
- **MyISAM** - Default, very fast. Ignores all foreign key constraints
- **InnoDB** - Offers transactions and foreign keys (**We use this one**)
- **Memory** - Stored in RAM

## Deleting Tables
Can delete table by using `DROP`
Need to be extremely careful, all rows in the table will be deleted and wont normally be asked to confirm deletion

## Changing Tables
Sometimes want to change the structure of an existing table
- Could drop the table but its better to `ALTER TABLE` instead as no data would be lost
- `ALTER TABLE` can:
	-  Add/remove columns
	-  Add/remove existing constraints
	-  Change column name or definition

- `INSERT` - add a new row to a table
	- Inserts rows into the database with the specified values
	- Number of columns and values must be the same
- `UPDATE` - change row(s) in a table
	- Changes values in specified rows based on `WHERE` conditions
	- If no condition is given all rows are changed
- `DELETE` - Remove row(s) from a table
	- Removes all rows, or those which satisfy a condition. If no condition given, ALL rows deleted.
- Should use `WHERE` to ensure only the required data is deleted, not lots of it

## Select
The type of query you will use most often
Queries one or more tables and returns the result as a table
Queries can be achieved in a number of ways

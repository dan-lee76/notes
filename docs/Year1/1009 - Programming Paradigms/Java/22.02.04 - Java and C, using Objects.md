String Class - const char *
String Buffer class - const char

Do not create any static methods apart from main
Can create other static methods in a class
- Methods can call other static methods
- Can pass parameters
- Like global functions
Using static methods, the code is not being executed on a specific object, so not really object oriented

## Java Conventions
Use capital first letter for class names
Use lower case first letter for variable names and method/function names
With multiple words, capitalise the first letter of subsequent words
## Data types in Java
'char' in Java is a 2 byte number to allow for extended character sets
### Objects
- Use object references to refer to object
- Object references act like C struct pointers
- Need to use new to create the object
- Assigning one reference to another means 'make it refer to the same object'
- Passing an object reference into a function, or returning one, means referring to the same object, NOT creating a new one.

### String
- Do not need to create them
- using + operator with `String` objects create a new `String` - without new
- Passed around like objects
- Use `StringBuffer` object if need to change a strings contents

### Auto-boxing and unboxing
Classes to wrap each of the basic data types
Can sometimes treat basic types as if they are objects

## Java command line args
use `.length` to find the length
Array of commands inside args
There is no filename as the first argument 

## Applying Functions
Expressed as `object,function()`
Means apply the function on the object and pass the parameters

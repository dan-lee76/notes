## Object Orientation
- OO systems are viewed as compositions of **domain specific object abstractions**, rather than data and functions
- Objects associate **data** and **behaviour**
- In a system they intercommunicate by sending messages to each other
	- Synchronous - method/function call
-	 Asynchronous - Leave a message
- An object is a domain concept
	- State - data
	- Behaviour - methods
	- Identity - unique identifier
Setter - Method which allows us to set the value of the data in the object
Getter - Method which allows us to get the current value of the data in the object
## Decomposition
Reduces how much you have to consider at the same time
Procedural Decomposition splits the program into a number of procedures/functions
Fewer interacting things make the problem  simpler in mind
Involves modelling the world in objects rather than functions

# Identifying classes and objects
Java classes already exist for most of what we would want to do
Abstraction means that we can deal with the classes on the basis of 'what they do' not 'how they do it' 

# Summary
Can decompose tasks into interacting objects
Can add functions/methods to classes
```java
objectRef.methodName()
```
These methods refer to the data for the current object

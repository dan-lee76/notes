# Introduction to objects and Java
Object Oriented Paradigm - Way you think about code and programming. Libraries for mostly everything.
Think it as interacting objects which have a state and can do things
## Benefits of OO
Improved understanding of program structure
- Logical structure, reflecting real world
- Especially large programs, give useful decomposition

Can easily reuse sections of code, and ease of change
Can debug code easily, enforce constraints, and easier to validate changes.
- Modular nature, and encapsulation help to localise problems

Things will be in memory and will be able to track itself. Objects have limits on what can change the data, only certain things can alter it
## What is an OOL
Language which promotes or allows object oriented programming and design:
- Objects (and classes)
- Encapsulation (methods and data together)
- Data hiding (restricts access to data)
- Composition (stronger than aggregation)
- Inheritance (reuse)
- Abstraction (and interfaces)
- Polymorphism (dynamic dispatch)
Classes are 'plans' for an objects

### Better support for OO programming
- Enforcing OO behaviour
- Fewer lines of code to get )) behaviour
- Explicit syntax: more obvious what code is doing
## Java
Compiled to an intermediate 'byte code' which is executed on target devices. 
Resulting `.class` file can be run on any platform inside a 'virtual machine' (JVM)
### Advantages
- 'Run anywhere'
- Many libraries of reusable classes
- Focus on language and library design is *often* on good OOP rather than speed
- Reuse of classes is important, speeds up development and speeds debugging

Don't need to worry about pointers
## Objects and Classes
C structs can be considered to be very simple objects
**Class** - Blueprint for creating an object
**Object** - Some collection of data that exists at runtime which can apply functions to
Can have many different 'instances' of a class. Types of things are still *classes* not *objects* - they are still *designs* rather than a specific style. With an object should be able to say *this one*

Classes specify what is **in** objects of that type
Objects are **instances** of classes

**public** - anything can access it
**private** - only the class members can access it

All executable code in Java must be in classes
Functions = methods

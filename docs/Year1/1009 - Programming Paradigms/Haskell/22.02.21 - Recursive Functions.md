Many functions can be defined in terms of other functions

## Recursive Function
Recursive - Functions can also be defined in terms of themselves

```haskell
fac 0 = 1
fac n = n * fac(n-1)
```

Reasons why recursion are useful:
- Some are simpler to define in terms of other functions (factorial)
- Many can naturally be defined in terms of themselves
- Properties of functions defined using recursion can be proved using the simple but powerful mathematical technique of induction

## Recursion on Lists
Recursion not restricted to numbers, can also be used to define functions on lists

## Multiple Arguments
Functions with more than one argument can also be defined using recursion 
```haskell
zip :: [a] -> [b -> [(a,b)] -- Defines type
zip []    _    = [] -- Base Case -- If either lists are empty, cant merge, so return empty list
zip _    []    = [] -- Base Case  
zip (x:xs) (y:ys) = (x,y) : zip xs ys -- pair up the first values of the list
```

## Quicksort
Quicksort algorithm can be specified by:
- The empty list is already sorted; - base case
- Non empty lists can be sorted by the tail values $\le$ the head, sorting the tail values > the head, and then appending the resulting lists on either side of the head value

# Functions
## Conditional Expressions
```haskell
abs :: Int -> Int
abs n = if n >= 0 then n else -n
```

Can be nested
```haskell
signum :: Int -> Int
signum n = if n < 0 then -1 else
			if n == 0 then 0 else 1
```
Conditional expressions must always have an else branch, which avoids any possible ....... # 1

## Guarded Equations
Alternative is guarded equations
```haskell
abs n | n >= 0	= n
			| otherwise = n
```
`|` means such that
## Pattern Matching
Clear definition
```haskell
not :: Bool -> Bool
not False = True
not True = False
```

Symbol `_` is a while card that matches any argument values. 

Patterns are matched in order.
```haskell
_ && _ = False
True && True = True
```
Any 2 arguments would satisfy the first one, so True would never be outputted
Patterns may not repeat variables.

## List Patterns
- Internally, every non-empty list is constructed by repeated use of an (:) called 'cons' that adds an element to the start of a list
- Functions on lists can be defined used `x:xs` patterns
- `x:xs` patterns only match non-empty lists
- Patterns must be parenthesised, because application has priority over (:)
## Lambda Expressions
Constructed without naming the functions by using lambda expressions. Nameless function that takes a number x and returns the result x+x

Typed as `\.` 
### Why they're useful
Used to give a formal mean to functions defined using currying
Can be used to avoid naming functions that are only referenced once,

## Operator Sections
An operator written between its two arguments can be converted into a curried function written before its two arguments by using parentheses.

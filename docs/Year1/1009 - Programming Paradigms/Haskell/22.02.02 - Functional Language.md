## Functional Language
Functional programming is style of programming maths

Easier to program functional than using computation method with assignments (java/c/for loop)

Instead of doing for loop can do. This builds a list 1 - 10
`sum [1..10]`

1987 - An international committee starts the development of Haskell, the standard lazy functional language

`f(x:xs) = f ys ++ [x] ++ f zs`

`++` - appends lists together
`:` - Takes single item(number) and moves it into the list. Can also be used to break apart the list. `x:xs` always adds a new element `x` to the start of a list `xs`

`[a | a ← xs, a ≤ x]`
Building a set of all values `a`, such that is is element of `xs` and a is `≤` to `x`

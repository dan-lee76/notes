# Haskell
## Key Concepts
Saying what to compute rather than how
`sum . map (^2) . filter even`
Separating pure and inpure code:
`Int -> Bool` vs `Int -> IO Bool`
Functions as first-class citizens:
`map :: (a->b) -> [a] -> [b]`
Equational reasoning
`map f . map g` = `map (f . g)`

## Main Drawbacks
- Difficult to reason about efficiency 
- Limited tool support for developers
- Requires ability to think abstractly 

# Java
## Key OO features
- **Objects**: This we create using new
- **Classes**: Specify what is in an object and what we can do to them
- **Encapsulation (methods and data together**: Put the methods which act on the data in the class
- **Abstraction (and interfaces)**: Only worry about what methods do, not how they are implemented
- **Data hiding (restrict access to data**: Make data private and the 'interface' methods public
- **Composition (stronger than aggregation)**: Objects can contain other objects - and use them to do the work
- **Inheritance(specialisation, reuse, 'is-a'**: Reuse things like JButton and JLabel behaviour
- **(Sub-type) Polymorphism (dynamic dispatch, late binding**: Behaviour only known at runtime, also the reason that Lambdas can 'wrap up' a function
- **Generics (parametric polymorphism)**: Implemented using sub-type polymorphism

Everything is an object in Java.
State is usually mutable
Prefer iteration as being more efficient

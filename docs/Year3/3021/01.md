# The Value of Visualisation

## Why create visualisation
- Answer questions
- Make decisions
- See data in context
- Expand memory
- Support graphical calculation
- Find patterns

> Record information. Communicate that information to others and to analyse and support reasoning

Reasoning/Exploration - can answer questions you didn't know to ask

### Key applications of IV
1. Record Information
2. Communications (presentation)
3. Reasoning (analysis)

## The Visualisation Process

Data Transformation - Create a structural model (schema), mapping raw data into data tables
Visual Mapping - Create a visual spatial model, transforming data tables into visual structures
View Transformations - Create views of the Visual Structures by specifying graphical parameters such as position, scaling, and clipping

### Stages
1. **Acquire** - Obtain the data, whether from a file on a disk or a source over a network
2. **Parse** - Provide some structure to the data, and order it into categories
3. **Filter** - Remove all but the relevant data
4. **Mine** - Apply methods from statistics or data mining as a way to discern patterns or place the data in mathematical context
5. **Represent** - Choose a visual model, such as a bar graph, list, or tree
6. **Refine** - Improve the basic representation to make it clear and more visually engaging
7. **Interact** - Add methods for manipulating the data or controlling what features are visible

## R Introduction

- Functional programming language written primarily in C, Fortran

`subset` - extract subsets meeting some criteria
`transform` - add or alter column of a data frame
`cut` - cut a continuous value into groups

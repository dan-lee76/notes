## Seven Stages of visualising data
1. **Acquire** - Obtain the data, whether through direct measurement, accessing an API , or retrieving it from a database
2. **Parse** - Interpret the data, often by converting it into a format that is useful for further analysis and visualisation
3. **Filter** - Remove unnecessary or irrelevant data to focus on the most important aspects
4. **Mine** - Apply data mining techniques to discover patterns, correlations, and insights within the data
5. **Represent** - Choose the appropriate visual representation that best conveys the insights and patterns identified in the previous stages
6. **Refine** - Improve the visualisation for clarity and effectiveness, focusing on aesthetics, readability, and usability
7. **Interact** - Allow users to interact with the data visualisation, enabling them to explore and manipulate the data to gain deeper insights. 

These stages provide a structured approach to turning raw data into meaningful visual information.

## Automating the Design of Graphical Presentations of Relational Information
- Explores methods for automating the design of effective graphical presentations.
- Aim is to develop a tool that can automatically generate graphical representations by applying codified design
- Treats graphical presentations as languages with syntactic and semantic rules
- Prototype called APT (A Presentation Tool) which leverages these design principles using composition algebra

## The Visual Display of Quantitative Information

### Chapter 1: Graphical Excellence

This chapter introduces the principles of "graphical excellence," focusing on clarity and precision in data visualization. Tufte emphasizes that effective graphics should communicate complex ideas with clarity and be both aesthetically pleasing and rich in information. Graphical excellence includes avoiding distortions, promoting comparisons, and presenting multivariate data. Tufte’s advocacy for simplicity and integrity in visual data presentation underpins the work as a whole.

### Chapter 2: Graphical Integrity

Tufte argues that graphical integrity is essential, focusing on how data representation should accurately reflect the underlying data. He warns against misleading representations, such as using non-zero baselines or disproportionate visuals that exaggerate trends. Tufte introduces the “Lie Factor,” a measure to assess distortion, and emphasizes the importance of maintaining a truthful, proportionate relationship between visuals and their corresponding data.

### Chapter 4: Data-Ink and Graphical Redesign

In this chapter, Tufte explores the concept of "data-ink," the ink in a graphic that directly represents data. He advocates for minimizing non-essential ink to reduce "chartjunk," enhancing readability and focusing on essential data. He provides redesign examples, showing how removing decorative elements can lead to a clearer and more effective display of information.

### Chapter 5: Chartjunk - Vibrations, Grids, and Ducks

Tufte critiques "chartjunk," or unnecessary decorative elements that can detract from the readability and effectiveness of data displays. He discusses elements like excessive grid lines, ornamental graphics, and "ducks" (graphics with excessive decoration). Tufte asserts that such elements distract from the data, and advises focusing on clarity and relevance instead.

### Chapter 6: Data-Ink Maximization and Graphical Design

Continuing from chapter 4, Tufte expands on the idea of maximizing data-ink. He suggests reducing non-data ink while preserving clarity, arguing that simplicity and minimalism improve both understanding and aesthetics. Tufte emphasizes efficient use of space and design choices that highlight data relationships without adding visual clutter.

### Chapter 8: Data Density and Small Multiples

This chapter introduces the concept of “data density,” encouraging higher data-to-ink ratios to maximize information per unit area in graphics. Tufte promotes “small multiples” — a series of similar small graphics that enable quick comparison across data sets or categories. This method, he argues, enhances understanding by presenting data in a visually organized, accessible format.

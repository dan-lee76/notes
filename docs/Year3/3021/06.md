# Interactions
## Need
- Larger data, there is simply too much to show in a coherent manner. Hard for people to process
- Helps us address that challenge

## What is 
Can be captured and measured by the response time
- 0.1 sec - animation, visual continuity, sliders
- 1 sec - system response, conversation break
- 10 sec - cognitive response

## Challenges
- Interaction seems to be a difficult thing to pin down and characterize
- User-centered versus system-centered characterizations
	- User intent: what a user wants to achieve through a specific interaction technique 

## Taxonomy of Interactions based on User Intent
### 1. Select
- Mark items of interest
- Often followed by further actions
- Mouse Selection - Clocking on an item selects it and attributes of the data point are shown
- Generalized Selection - Can select multiple items and filter
### 2. Explore - show me something different
- Enables users to examine a different subset of data
- Overcome the limitation of display size
- Panning in Google Earth
### 3. Reconfigure - show me a different arrangement
- Provide different perspectives by changing the spatial arrangement of representation
- Sorting and rearranging columns in TableLens
- Changing the attributes in a scatter plot
- The baseline adjustment feature in Stacked Histogram
### 4. Encode - show me a different representation
- Change visual appearances (colour, shape, size etc)
- May interactively change entire data representation
### 5.Abstract/Elaborate - show me more or less detail
- Adjust the level of abstraction
- Details on demand
- Unfolding, drill-down, zooming
### 6. Filter - show me something conditionally
- Change the set of data items being present based on some specific conditions
- Change the data being present; focusing, narrowing/widening
- Dynamic Query - Each filtering interaction essentially is an SQL query
### 7. Connect - show me related items
- Highlight associations and relationships
- Show hidden data items that are relevant to a specified item
### Brushing
- Very common technique in Info Visualisation
- Applies when you have multiple views of the same data
- Selecting or highlighting a case in one view generates highlighting the case in the other views

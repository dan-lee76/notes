## Dilemmas
- An ethical dilemma is a situation where competing options all have imperfect outcomes
- e.g.
	- It is not clear which rule applies
	- More than one rule applies but they are in conflict
- Ethics is rarely clear-cut; typically involves dilemmas

## Deontology
- Greek word "deon" meaning; "To be obligated" or simply "duty"
- Morality of an action lies on the inner motive rather than the external effects
- Kants' ethics is primarily based on the idea of the good will
- Duty must be done out of pure reverence to the moral law

## Categorical Imperative
> Act only according to that maxim by which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law

- Maxim is a personal and subjective guiding principle
- We must universalize our moral judgement

## Teleology
- Telos = Greek for "goal" (fulfilment or completion, consummation, end)
- Most prominent type of teleological ethics: Utilitarianism
- Ethical theory: the action which leads to greatest utility is ethically best

## Act utilitarianism
- It asks a person to asses the effects of all actions
- Rejects the view that actions can be classified as right or wrong in themselves
- Example: lying is ethical if it produces more good than bad

## Rule utilisation
- It asks a person to assess actions according to a set of rules designed to yield the greatest net benefit to all affected
- Compares act to rules
- Does not accept an action as right if it maximizes net benefits only once
- Example: lying is **always*** wrong or "thou shalt not lie"

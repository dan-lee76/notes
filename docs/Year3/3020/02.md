# Application of ethical theories

## Aristotle's Ethics
- Good is that at which all things aims
- The proper function or excellence of a things is its *arete* (virtue)
- The human arete or virtue is activity of the soul in accordance with virtue (over a lifetime)

### Happiness: The Self-sufficient end
- Most of the ends (goals) we seek are instrumental steps towards some ultimate goal.
- Aristotle identifies happiness as that which we seek as a goal that is an end in itself
- Happiness comes from developing a good character
- A good character comes from the development of good habits

### Human Virtue
- It can not be simply living and growing - trees do that as well
- It can not be related to characteristics we share with animals
- The quality that seems distinctively human is the use of reason. 
- Humans can have two kinds of virtue
	- Intellectual Virtues - Relate to our professions
	- Moral Virtues - Common to all humans

### Good Character
- Virtuous thoughts lead to good acts
- Virtuous acts (following the mean) can lead to good habits
- Good habits make for a good character
- A good character can be happy

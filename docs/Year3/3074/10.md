# Advanced topis part 2

- Most of AI and ML focuses on full automation
- Bigger and bigger datasets/models
- Good for benchmarking, less good for actual applicaiton
- Datasets are saturated with highly specific models
- Models specialise so much they cannot adapt

### Need to keep humans in the loop
- Interactive sense-making: Visualisation + Analysis + Training
- **Explainable AI**: Explanation + Analysis + Training
- Adversarial training with humans in the loop: Generative Adversarial Networks + Training
- **Active learning**: Sampling + Training
- Meta Learning: Human-guided training

## Interpretable Machine Learning
Interpretability brings advantages:
- Human expert can double check a result
- Human user can therefore take liability
- A ML/AI developer can debug the inference process
Does bring drawbacks:
- Additional drawbacks
- Comes at performance cost

### Taxonomy of interpretability
- **Intrinsic** vs **post hoc**
- **Model-specific** vs **model-agnostic**
- **Local** vs **Global** 
### Model-agnostic methods
....

### Global Surrogate Model
Use an interpretable model that is trained to approximate the predictions of a black box model

### Local Surrogate Model
- Local surrogate models are used to explain individual predictions of black box machine learning models

### Explaining with examples
...

### Counterfactual Explanation

### Prototypes
- Finding instances which are representative of a class
- A criticism is an instance that is not well covered by prototypes

## Active Learning
### Motivation
- Traditional supervised learning
	- Labelled training examples are randomly sampled from the training set and fed into the ML algorithm
- Active Learning
	- The ML algorithm starts from scratch and asks the user to label specific data points

Most Popular Approach: Uncertainty sampling

# Advanced CUI Design

## Branching and Disambiguation
### Constrained Responses
- Designing the prompt to constrain the response, so that the response is likely to contain a single keyword to progress
	- What **city** are you traveling to
	- What is your main **symptom**
- Good strat is to used *N-best lists* based on the users following constrained response
	- Containing the N likely matches to find the correct results
	- Then iterate over the list until the user confirms

### Open Speech
- To allow for flow when the response doesn't need to be processed
- Provide a general reply
- Similar to the generic confirmation strategy
- Can be used to obtain information in a 'natural', 'conversational' way
### Categorisation of input
- Customizing user input
### Wildcards and logical expressions
- Wildcards allows for more flexibility by allowing certain words to be repeated without having to specify them explicitly 
- Logical expressions to link keywords/phrases together

### Disambiguation
- Different kinds of situation that require disambiguation
	- Not enough information
	- More than one piece of information, when only one is expected

## Dialog Management and other advanced topics
- Need to recognise both object and intent (What the user wants to do with it)
	- **Show** me my calendar
	- **Add** an event to my calendar
	- **Delete** my meeting from my calendar
- Intent and object are usually combined in the concept of utterances

### Sentiment Analysis
- The process of computationally identifying and categorizing opinions expressed in a piece of text
- Whether the writers attitude towards a particular topic, product is pos, neg or neut
- NLP needed.

### TTS vs. recorded speech
- Synthetic generated vs recorded human speech
	- TTS much better than what it was, good range of voices available
	- Recording voice talent can make your VUI sound more natural
	- Pronunciation, prosody adapted to contextual/local nuances 

### Speaker Verification
- AKA voice biometric authentication
- Could be used for authentication for security

### Personalisation
- Using the user's name and other information about the user to personalise the chatbots prompts
- Greeting the user according to time zone etc

### Advanced multimodal
- Hybrid strategies of voice and visual output
- Could also have hybrid strategies of voice and visual input

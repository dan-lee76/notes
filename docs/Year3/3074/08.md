# Conversational and Voice User Interfaces

## Conversational UI/UX
- CUI = Conversational User Interface
- Can refer to text-based chatbots
- UX = User Experience
	- Broader term encompassing experience of the interaction, not just design of interfaces and information

### VUI Example
- ASR = Automated Speech Recognition
- wakeword detection + acoustic model-based transcription + confidence level
- NLU/NLP
	- Keyword recognition + intent matching + variable/slot
- Dialogue management + TTS vocalisation
	- Response generation
### Challenges
- Voice is a profoundly personal trait
- Reflects where you're from, mother tongue, dialect and accent etc
- Issues around privacy and surveillance
	- Pertinent given the often intimate/home environment in which VUIs are placed

## Socio-economic challenges
- Dialects, accents and pitch
- VUIs struggle more with certain dialects, worst for the Scottish
- Accuracy also lower for higher pitched voices
- Could contain racial bias

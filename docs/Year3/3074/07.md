# Text classification

## Classification as generalisation
- Core assumption: our data is representative of the real world (sampled from the same distribution)
- Language competency classifier trained in this class

**Machine learning** - techniques that enable a computer to learn from examples
**Deep learning** - neural networks with multiple layers
**Training a supervised model** -  iteratively modifying parameters of the model to minimise training error in a way that (we think) leads to minimising generalisation error, which we estimate with testing error

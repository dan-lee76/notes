# Basic CUI Design Principles

>Very important for coursework
> - Prompt design
> - Context tracking
> - Personalisation
> - Error Handling
> - Confirmation
> - Discoverability

## Conversational Design
- One shot interaction vs. multiple turns
- Smart speakers are one shot - requires a wake word to explicitly invoke the interaction
- Conversational - Use of prompt design, mean the developers design of the system response.
- These are called conversational markers
- Good prompt design makes use of conversational markers (and other things)

> Dont expect chatbot (cw) to be like this

### Conversational Design
- Provide clear, actionable promopts
- Be concise, speech is ephemeral
- Help the user understand what they can do
- Help the user recover from errors

## CUI Design Process and Tools
> Expected to use in CW
Support process from early concept to fully working prototype

Sample Dialog between CUI and user
- Avoids writing prompts in isolation, which can lead to stited user experience
- Pick 5 most common use cases (3 for cw) for your CUI
	- Start with "blue sky" best path dialogs
	- Also write for when things go wrong, focus on recovery
- Can be useful to illustrate early concept to stakeholders
- Can be enacted in a table read with another person, good way to improve your wording
- Good CUIs use clear language; it can take time to get this right!

Use visual mockups, flow diagrams

## Confirmations
- Getting the user to confirm an action
- Over-confirmation can be a problem
- Considerations for choosing a confirmation strategy ...

### Types
- Explicitly confirmation - Requires the user to take another turn to explicitly confirm
- Implicit confirmation - Does not require the user to say anything else

### Methods
- Three-tiered confidence
- Implicit confirmation
- Nonspeech confirmation
- Generic confirmation
- Visual Confirmation
- .....

## Error Handling
- Reprompt is the traditional response if user was not heard or understood.
- Silence can work in much the same way as a repromt
	- Silence in human conversations in sign of trouble

### Kind of errors
- No speech detected
- Speech detected, but nothing recognized
- Something was recognized incorrectly
- Something was recognized but the system does the wrong thing with it
- No speech detected
- Speech detected, nothing recognized. Call it out explicitly to repeat question
- Something was recognized incorrectly
- Heard correctly, but does the wrong thing with it

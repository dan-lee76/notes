# User Testing for CUI
## User Testing
- Special considerations for VUIs
- Does your VUI understand the way people actually talk to it
- Is the dialog management effective
### Why testing with real users
- Par and parcel of human-centered/user centered design
- Find problems early on in the process and fix them
- Most technology is designed to be used by and useful for people so should be tested with them too
- People draw on prior experience when interacting with technology which can help or hinder
- Improves your product
- People can have expert/local knowledge

### Designing a user study
- What is the goal
- What tasks are you asking the user to do
- What sort of participants
- What data collection and analysis are you doing

### Task definition
- Designed to exercise the parts of the system you want to test
- Focused on primary dialog of paths
	- High risk areas
	- Address the major goals
- Write the task definitions carefully to avoid biasing the participant
- Describe the goal of the task

### Task ordering
- To avoid order effects, randomise tasks if possible, use a Latin Square design, each task in every person
- Use counterbalance if using conditions

### Data Analysis
- Myriad approaches
- Quantitave
	- Hypothesis testing
	- Descriptive and inferential statistics
	- Algorithmic/mathematical
- Qualitative
	- Thematic analysis (themes)
	- Conversation analysis
	- Interaction analysis

## Early Stage and Usability Testing
### Early-stage testing
- Testing concepts
- Table reads with sample dialogcs
- Initial reactions to mock-ups
- Wizard of Oz testing
	- Human behind the curtain simulates fully working system
	- Realistic but much cheaper/quicker
	- Elicitation study to learn what lan/terms people use


## Prelease and Pilot Testing
- Dialog traversal testing
	-  Purpose is to make sure that the system accurately implements the dialog specification in complete detail
	- Test all transactions
- Loading testing
	- Verifying that the system will perform under the stress of many concurrent user sessions

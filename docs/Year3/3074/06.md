# The Dark Side of NLP

## Bots and fake news

## Filter Bubbles
- Information based on your views, likes, friends (and their views)

### Problems
- May come from a well-meaning but na√Øve world-view
- But they create "alternative realities"
- They tend to amplify misinformation
- Echo chamber effect. They tend to group people that are alike together

## Filter bubbles: examples and research
- Loads of misinformation and fake stories

### Solutions
- Fact checking - Organisations are starting to do this
- Education - People need to learn media competency/literacy
- Tools and technological improvements - Flagging, moderation, algorithms
- Regulation - Laws, GDPR, Online Safety Bill

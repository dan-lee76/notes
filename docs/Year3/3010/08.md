# Same Time-Different Place

## Video Comms
- Technology ranges over time
	- Dedicated systems - internet, webcam, mobile phones
- 3 Major uses
	- Explicit Videoconferencing
	- Pervasive social context
	- Integration into collaborative tools
- Reasons for use
	- (Hopefully) cheaper (not just money) than traveling

## Access Grid
- A collection of resources and technologies that enables large format audio and video based collaboration between groups of people in different locations
- Developed at Argonne National Laboratory
- Part of "The Grid" - a network of high performance computing nodes
- Theoretically no limit to number of connected sites

## Gaza Awareness
- Several states of gaze awareness
- Mutual Gaze awareness - eye contact - knowing if someone is looking at you
- Partial Gaze awareness - knowing the direction someone is looking
- Full Gaze awareness - knowing what someone is looking at
## Spatial Faithfulness
- How accurately each users gaze or gesture is conveyed to the other participants in relation to them and their physical space
- Distorted by separating camera and screen

## Mutual Spatial Faithfulness
- When A looks at B, B can see A is looking at him
- Same with when not looking
- Simultaneously trye for both (all) people
- Then they have mutual spatial faithfulness
- Difficult in groups as dont know where people are etc

## Gaza-2
- 3D meeting room with video avatars
- Avatars automatically route and face the avatar of the person they are talking to
	- Based on eye tracking
	- Others see who each person is looking at

## MultiView
- For group-to-group meetings
- Tries to coordinate spatial faithfulness
- Show to 
	- preserve gaze awareness
	- encourage trust formation
	- encourage common ground

## Moving onto Media Spaces
- Usually video-broadcast of (multiple) remote locations
- For awareness not for supporting communication
	- thus uses lower framerates
- Usually long term, persistent video connections
	- Rather than per-use connections

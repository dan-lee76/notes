## Virtual Environments
- Computer generated, 3D environmental which the user of the technology perceives themselves to be
- A space that contains data representations and users
- Aim to increase telepresence through interactivity and vividness
## VR Systems
- Can be fully immersive or desktop driven
- High-end for specific experiences
- Low-end to be more accessible
- Standard desktop hardware
- More scalable for many users

## CVE Design Considerations
- Choice of embodiments
	- Realism vs conveying capabilities
- Interaction mapping
- Understanding the viewpoint of others
	- And more generally awareness of others
- Flexible and multiple viewpoints
- Creation of a sense of place
## Mixed Reality
- Merging of physical and digital
- Seeing views of the real world in VR
- Controlling views of the real world in VR or through physical controls
- Seeing views of VR in the real word (augmented reality)

### Kinect Fusion
- Technology behind HoloLens
- Tracks the 6DOF position of handheld depth sensing cameras, such as Kinect
- Performs high quality 3D surface reconstructions as the camera moves through space

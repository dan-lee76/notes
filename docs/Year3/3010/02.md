# Same time same place - Meeting rooms and shared surfaces

Traditional tools consist of WYSIWIS (What you se is what I see). Everyone should be exactly on the same page

### Tools
- Colab - Xerox PAC - 2-6 pcs linked to support f2f meetings
- Boardnoter - General drawing
- Cognoter - Supports meetings to organise a presentation, brainstorming, organise ideas etc
- The i-Land - Vision for collaborative offices, using everything
- HuddleLamp - Desk lamp with an integrated RGB-D camera. Tracks the movements and positions of mobile displays and hands
- Air Constellations - Magical move device near and watch it react

### Relaxing WYSIWIS
Where strict showed everyone the same thing, colab taught us that its best to relax some dimensions in order to make collaboration more effective
- Display Space - WYSIWIS for a subset of visual objects
- Time of display - provide control over when it updates
- Subgroups - allow interaction in dynamic subgroups
- Congruence - Allow information to be seen differently in different situations


### Cross device interactions
- Modularity and rapid re-configurability of device
- Need to sense where devices are in space
	- e.g. for easily redirecting input to devices, directional gestures, transferring content
	- computer vision techniques, short-range infrared sensing, radio-based sensing such as Bluetooth or near-field communication


**Shared Interactive Surfaces** - Several people use the same surfaces

**Microsoft PixelSense** - Rear projection replaced by augmented LCD technology. Optical sensing system, fully integrated into a thin form factor display

**Tangible User Interface** - Originally Graspable User Interfaces
- Originally developed from the idea of direct manipulation
	- Direct movement of objects in user interfaces
- TUIs - Moving an actual object to more virtual objects

### Common Areas of Conflict
- Moving/Re-orienting things that other people are looking at
- Editing things people are working on
- Stealing objects from one persons collection
- Closing/removing objects that other people are using

### Conclusions
- There are many ways to make f2f meetings more flexible
	- Tools focus on portability of information
	- Tools focus on privacy, sharing, and control
	- Relaxed WYSIWIS
- Tabletops can provide multi-person collaboration
	- People prefer small private territories/controls & shared spaces
	- Software can help collaboration by invoking shared policies

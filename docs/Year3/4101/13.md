# Credential Stealers

Malware trying to steal credentials

- MFA makes them less useful (but still exploitable)
- Also other things that can act as a credential
- Particularly for cloud/web based services
- Often done by storing a session identifier in a cookie. Cookies are key-value pairs stored in your browser
- Can steal the file, and then impersonate the user

Three general approaches
1. Programs that wait for a user to login
2. Programs that dump information stored in Windows
3. Programs that log keystrokes

## Keyloggers
- Intercepting Windows login or hash duping will provide details of the username and password to log into the computer
- Potentially other computers on the network
- Will not provide details of logins for other resources
- Keylogging will capture all keys pressed
- This will capture any password typed into the system (and a lot more)
- Need to find the passwords
- Can be implemented in both kernel and user space
- Kernel-based keyloggers are difficult to detect with user-mode applications

## User-Space Keyloggers
Windows API provides two ways to implement in user-space
- *Hooking* - get Windows to notify the malware every time a key is pressed
- *Polling* - Malware interrogates windows to see if a specific key is pressed

## Hooking Keyloggers
- Typically make use of `SetWindowsHookEx()` - Allows you to monitor for various events
- Typically will include a `.exe` which will initiate the hook function
- `.dll` to handle the logging
- Injected into other processes on the system

### Implementing
- Create a DLL that exports a `KeyboardProc` or `LowLevelKeyboardProc` call-back function
- Should call `CallNextHookEx()` to ensure that the program still works as expected
- Load the library with `LoadLibraryA()`
- Get the address of the function (`GetProcAddress()`)
- Call `SetWindowsHookEx()` to hook the function in
- A `dwThreadID` of zero will hook into all threads on the current desktop

## Implementing a polling keylogger
- Polling keyloggers are conceptually much simpler
- Make use of the `GetAsyncKeyState()` API function
- Can also tell you if key was pressed last time `GetAsyncKeyState()` was called
- Tests whether a specific key is pressed
- Can iterate through every key on the keyboard to test all of them to find which are pressed
- Check the state of Shift/Caps lock as well
- Test each key on keyboard to see if pressed, sleep for a bit, repeat

## Identifying Keyloggers
- Polling keyloggers will often leave tell-tale signs in the strings of the program
- If the malware wants to log all keys, then it will need to have names for keys 
- Follow the strings back to the code that implements it

## Windows Login
- Allows you to extend the login mechanism
- In XP done by Graphical Identification and Authentication (GINA)
- Later uses Credential Providers
- Possible to use these to install credential stealers by pretending to be a provider

## Gina Interception
- `fsgina.dll` exports the same function that `msgina.dll` exported
- Most functions get called directly, apart from `WlxLoggedOutSAS()` - password would be copied

## Hash Dumping
- Aim to copy the password hashes off the system
- Often get the equivalent
- Source code for several tools available, often used by malware authors
- Recognised by antivirus software

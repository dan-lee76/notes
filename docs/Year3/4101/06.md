# Anti-Disassembly

- Look at the disassembled instructions and start to understand the program
- But malware authors use the same tools as malware analysts
- They use anti-disassembly techniques to stop us analysing the code

## Anti-Disassembly
- Aims is to slow down the analyst
- Make the job of disassembly as hard as possible
- Reality is that any code that can be executed can be disassembled
- Malware authors aim is to push the skill required up as much as possible
- Same techniques also help prevent anti-virus heuristics from analysing the code too

- Not talking about trying to camouflage code or data
- Will see ways to do that
- Rather looking at how code can be written
	- So the disassembler misinterprets it
	- But the CPU can still execute it without any issue

## Assembly
- Assembler is relatively straight-forward
- Take an instruction, convert it into the relevant machine code opcodes
- Move onto the next instruction
- Result is a stream of bytes for the CPU to execute

## Disassembly
- Harder problem
- Easy to convert a single instruction, once we know where it starts
- Program is a stream of bytes, one after the other
- x86 instructions can vary in length from 1-15 bytes
- Cannot decode an instruction, until we know where it starts
- Cannot know where an instruction starts, until we decode the previous instruction

## Anti-Disassembly
- Key to understanding the techniques
- Understand they are trying to force disassembler to make the wrong decisions about where instructions start
- So disassemble phoney instructions made up of bytes from the middle of real instructions
- Need to understand how a disassembler is implemented
- CPU dependent

## Disassembly Techniques
- Take in one or more bytes (depending on the length)
- Convert that to the assembly code that would generate that instruction
- Move onto the next instruction
- Repeat
But next instruction might not be correct

Two approach generally used to determine next instruction; linear disassembly or flow disassembly
Flow disassembly generally gives better results than linear.

## Linear disassembly
### Method
- Decode first instruction at start address
- Then know the length (in bytes) of that instruction
- Add length to address of that instruction to give address of next instruction
- Repeat
### Thoughts
- Generally works
- Can go wrong even with non-malicious binaries
- Tempting to think that the `.text` section will only contain code
- Not necessarily the case, sometimes data is intermingled
- Linear disassembler would treat....

### Breaking
- Very easy to break a linear disassembler


## Flow Disassembly
- Aims to improve the detection of instructions (and rejection of data)
- Follows the flow of the program rather than linearly processing instructions

### Instruction Flow
Break instructions down into groups based on what instruction will execute next
- Always execute the next instruction
- Can execute either the next instruction of a specified one (`call`, `jz`,`jnz`)
- Always execute instructions at a specified address e.g. `jmp`
- Next instruction unknown, e.g. `ret`

- For simple instructions works just like linear disassembly

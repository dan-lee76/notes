# Processes 1
## Data Encoding
- Malware needs to hide its intent
- Applies to both its operation (i.e. its code) but also the data it uses
- Data encoding refers to any form of content modification used for the purpose of hiding intent
- Need to understand the encoding techniques used to understand what the malware does

## Base 64 Encoding
- Aims to translate binary data into ASCII characters that can be transmitted via email
- Less usable ASCII characters than possible values in a byte so encoded form larger than original
- Uses 64 characters
- Padded with `=` character if not a multiple of three bytes

- Converts three bytes of data into four Base64 characters
- Take the bytes to encode in groups of threes and pack as a 24-bit number
- First byte becomes the most significant eight bits, second byte goes in the middle eight bits, and third byte becomes LSB.

## Identifying Base64 Encoding
- Appears as a random selection of characters
- Also relatively straight-forward to identify the encoding/decoding routines in malware
- Another tell-tale sign is that the encode/decode functions will often contain a lone-padding character (`=`)

## Decoding Modified Base64
- Still relatively straight-forward to decode by using simple character substitution
- Find the look-up table used by the malware
- Take the encoded data, and convert each character from the malwares lookup table to the normal one
- Then feed into the standard decode routine

## Standard Cryptography 

## Custom Encoding
- Malware often uses homegrown encoding schemes
- One mechanism used to develop them in to layer simple encoding techniques
- Would be to develop a custom algorithm
- Custom encoding techniques retain the characteristics of simple encoding techniques
- Make the job of reverse-engineering much harder
- Need to identify the encoding process and develop a decoder
- Normal cryptographic routines require a key to work
- But with a custom routine the key is embedded in the code

## Cracking Custom Encoding
- Need to trace the programs execution to find the routines
- Think about how the malware will use the custom encoding
	- If encoding - routines will be called before the data is output
	- If decoding - routines will be called after the data is input
- Once code is found, need to develop a decoder
- Could implement...

## Processes
- By exploiting other legitimate process
- Not easily visible from outside
- Also gains privileges of the process it is injected into

## DLL
- Dynamic Link Library used to contain malware code
- Designed to be linked into other programs
- Gains the privileges of the program
- DLL search hijacking - exploit the way Windows searches for a DLL
- Requires the malware to have same name as a legitimate DLL

# Programs

## What is a program
**Code** - Instructions that make up the program
**Data** - Any data compiled into the program
**BBS** - Any uninitialised data

## Address
Can put this anywhere in memory, as they are all just bytes
- **Code** - Bytes that make up the opcodes for the programs instructions
- **Data** - Bytes that represent the data
- **BSS** - Bytes that we know will need to store things in at some point
Providing the address are know the program would work fine, tend to be a little more structured when creating programs

## Program Structure
- Find all the code is grouped together in one section (`.text` section)
- Followed by all the data grouped into another section (`.data` section)
- Followed by the BSS

## Benefits
- Combining the sections enables the OS to do nice things
- Code can be shared between multiple instances of the same program
- Can make the code sections of memory read-only
- Can make the data sections non-executable

## Libraries
- Same approach is take with static libs
- Code, data and BSS sections linked in which program code
- Libraries are often just a collection of object files
- Windows uses DLLs

## Executable File
- Each section of the final linked program is then stored on disk
- No need to store the BSS

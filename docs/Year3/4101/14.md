# Persistence 
- Various ways malware can get on a system
- Needs to ensure it stays on a system for a long time
- Otherwise rebooting the system would be enough to clear it
- Various mechanisms are available for the malware to hook in

## Via registry
- In the window registry that can be used to install malware permanently
- Most popular is to register yourself in `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run` and `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`
- Tools available that can show all the programs that will automatically run on your system

## Image File Execution Options
- This ^ settings in the registry
- Aimed at letting you debug a program
- Set at `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options\`
- Can set a key called `Debugger` which contains the full path to the debugger, or the malware
- Set this on a program that is likely to be run and the malware will be launched when the program is run

## APPINIT_DLLs
- `AppInit_Dlls` were loaded into every process that loads User32.dll
- Malware would therefore need to check what it was loaded into if it was targeting a specific process
- DLLs registered by adding the path to the `AppInit_DLL`s registry key under `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows`
- Key contains a space-delimited list of DLL paths to load
- Not available when windows is booted using secure boot

## Winlogon Notify
- Could also register a DLL to receive notifications when logon events happen
- DLL registered in registry at `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\`
- Under the key `Notify`
- DLL must be placed in the `system32` directory

## SVCHOST DLLs
- Malware often installed as a Windows service
- Typically requires implementing as a .exe
- svchost lets you implement a service as a DLL
- Many windows services are implemented as a DLL using svchost.exe
- Malware is able to blend in with the services and registry
- Each instance of svchost.exe contains a group of services
- Groups are defined in `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Svchost`
- Services are defined in `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\ServiceName`
- Malware authors will register with details that help in blend into the background.

## Trojanized System Binaries
- Another mechanism for persistence is to modify an existing binary
- Adding the malware code to the binary
- Also modifies the existing code so that the malware code is executed
- Result is that when the binary is next run, malware is also run
- Easy to spot when disassembling
## DLL Load-Order
Windows has defined search order
- Directory where the application is loaded
- System directory (`\Windows\System32\`)
- 16-bit system directory (`\Windows\System`)
- Windows directory (`\Windows`)
- Current directory
- Directories listed in the PATH environment variable
Also the `KnownDLLs` registry key is used to preload a specific list of DLLs
### Hijacking
- Possible to cause a different DLL to be loaded by hijacking the load-order
- Just need to place the malicious DLL in a directory higher up the load-order
- Windows will then load this one before the real DLL
- Malicious DLL can then load the real DLL to ensure the system continues to function

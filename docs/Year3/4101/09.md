# Processes 2

## Steps for DLL injection

- Call `OpenProcess()` to get `HANDLE` for the process
- Use `VirtualAllocEx()` to allocate memory inside the process
- Use `WriteProcessMemory()` to copy path to DLL into the process
- Use `CreateRemoteThread()` to create a new thread in the process
	- Start `LoadLibrary()` as the thread routine
	- Pass the address of the DLL path as data to the thread

## Direct Injection
- Related Technique - Inject code directly rather than path to DLL
- Use `VirtualAllocEx()` to allocate memory - need to ensure it is marked as executable
- `WriteProcessMemory()` used to copy over code
- `CreateRemoteThread()` used to start code
- Harder to write code for this - code isn't loaded so will need to find address of API function itself

## Non-Traditional Loading
- Code knows where the stack is (using esp)
- Can use this to create structures or store strings, by pushing the relevant values and capturing the address

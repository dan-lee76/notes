# Process of Malware Analysis 

Is an iterative process
- Static Analysis
- Dynamic Analysis
- Disassemble
- Debugging

Each tool provides us with evidence about what the program does
Can use this evidence to guide the way we search for more evidence
Think about how we might contradict that

## Ransomware
- Easy to see, encrypt all files on VM
- Could guide us how we start to look at the program in a disassembler
- Unable to use computer without paying a ransom to some party
- Usually encrypts all the files on the computer system
- Paying the ransom causes the party to send you the decryption key

### Modus Operandi
- Generate an encryption key
- Send key to ransomware author
- For every file on the computer (Certain file types, not OS ones)
	- Open File
	- Encrypt contents
	- Write encrypted content back into file
- Display ransom note to user

## Finding Files
- Windows provides system calls that can be used to iterate over each file in a directory
	- `FindFirstFile()`
	- `FindNextFile()`
	- `FindClose()`
- Can use dissembler to import these functions

# Data Encoding

- Malware needs to hide its intent
- Applies to both its operation (code) but also the data it uses
- Malware authors use anti-disassembly techniques to stop us analysing the code
- And data encoding to stop us from seeing any data

## Confusing a flow disassembler
- Need to get disassembler to decode the wrong bytes as instructions
- But also need to confuse its attempt to follow the flow
- Flow disassembler will decode both execution flows
- Those two flows refer to the same set of bytes

- Need a way to force the disassembler to decode the instructions one way
- But *not* the way the CPU would decode them
- Code runs fine, but the disassembler shows us the wrong instructions
- Can do this relatively easily by inserting code, which looks conditional to the disassembler

### Techniques
- Jumps to the same target
- Unconditional Conditional jumps
- Impossible disassembly
- Function Pointers
- Manipulating the return address from subroutines
## Anti-Anti-Disassembly
Any code that can be executed can be disassembled
May just have to guide the process a bit
- Explicitly choosing which parts of the program are code and data
- May have to patch the code with `nop` instructions to get it to disassemble correctly

## Data Encoding
- Malware needs to hide its intent
- Applies to both its operation but also the data it uses
- Data encoding refers to any form of content modification used for the purpose of hiding intent
- Need to understand the encoding techniques used to understand what malware does

## Malware data encoding
Malware will use data encoding to
- Hide configuration information
- Save information to a staging file before stealing it
- Store strings used by the malware
- Disguise itself as a legitimate tool

## Mechanisms for Data Encoding
- Malware could (and does) use standard cryptographic algorithms for data encoding
- But malware is just as likely to use simple techniques as complex ones
	- Small enough to be used in space-constrained enviroments
	- Less obvious than more complex ciphers
	- Low overhead, little impact on performance
- Not expecting immunity from being cracked, rather simply looking for an easy way to prevent basic analysis
## XOR Cipher
- Common mechanism used by malware authors is to use it
- XOR each byte of the data with a known value
- Convenient to use
	- Simple to implement (One instruction)
	- Reversible

## Brute forcing XOR encoding
- Very easy to brute force crack simple XOR encoding
- Only one of 255 possible values used to encode the data
- Simple take a portion of the encoding data and attempt to decode it using each of the 255 possible keys
- Look at the result and see if something recognisable pops out
- Can also be precomputed if knowing a string could be present

## Null-preserving single byte XOR encoding
- Malware authors sometimes use a technique to mitigate this
- Use NULL=preserving single byte encoding scheme
- Rather than XOR every byte, this has two rules
	- If byte is zero, or the key then the byte is skipped
	- If byte is neither zero or the key, then XOR byte with key
- Still a reversible algorithm
## XOR encoding
- Strait-forward to find this code in the disassembler
- Search for `xor` instructions
- XOR with a constant value
- XOR a register with another different register
- Look out for small loops containing `xor` instructions

## Variations on a theme
- Single byte encoding is relatively weak
- Malware authors have implemented more involved encoding schemes
- Less susceptible to brute-force, but just as simple to implement
	- Using addition/subtraction
	- Bit rotation
	- ROT-n
	- Multibyte

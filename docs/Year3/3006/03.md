# Authentication
- To allow some access to an asset we must ensure:
	- They are permitted to access that asset
	- They are who they say they are
- A process of verifying a user's identity
- Can attempt to verify identity using credentials

TOCTTOU - Time of check to time of use
- Repeated authentication
- At the start and during a session

## Problems with passwords
- People forget them
- Can be guessed
- Spoofing and Phishing
- Compromised files
- Keylogging

## Hash Functions
- Another cryptographic primitive in our toolbox
- Takes a message of any length, and returns a pseudorandom hash of fixed length
- $h(M):\{0,1\}^n\to\{0,1\}^{128}$
- Hash functions are used everywhere. Message auth, integrity, passwords
- Common hash functions - MD5, SHA-1. SHA-256

## Strong Hash Functions
- Output must be indistinguishable from random noise
- Bit changes must be diffused through the entire output
- For it to be useful, need to have important properties:
	- Cant be reversed
	- It is impractical to find messages that produce the same hash - hash collision
## Storing Passwords
- Storing encrypted passwords is better, but not perfect
- Using a one-way hash function is a much better solution

## Password/Shadow Files
- OS have taken steps to stop people reading hashes for offline attacks
- These files are now read protected

## Cracking Passwords
- Isn't always illegal, though sometimes it is
- Offline: Have a copy of the password hash locally. (Brute force approach)
- Online: You do not have the hash, and are instead attempting to gain access to an actual login terminal
- Online is usually attempted with phishing

## Dictionary Attacks
- Most password cracking is now achieved using dictionary attacks rather than brute force

## Password Salting
- Can improve security by prepending a random "salt" to a password before hashing
- The salt is stored unencrypted with the hash
- If use a different random salt for each user, get the following security benefits:
	- Cracking multiple passwords is slower
	- Prevents rainbow table attacks
- Salting has no effect on the speed of cracking a single password

## Hashing Speed
- When password cracking, the most important factor is the hashing speed
- New algorithms take longer as they are more complex
- Iterate to increase complexity - PBKDF2
- bcrypt cant be used on easily GPUs

## Pretexting
- Offer a pretext as a reason for needing private information
- Continue to rely on email address, DOB, Mothers maiden name etc

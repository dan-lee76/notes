# Internet Security
## Internet Threat Models
- The attacker isn't in control of the network
- Attacker hasn't got access to the target OS

## Cookies
- HTTP is a stateless protocol
- Most of what we do online is stateful
- Cookies are small text files used to provide persistence
- Servers can provide cookies during HTTP responses, using Set-Cookie
- Browsers will return any cookies for a given domain in GET and POST request

### Types
- Session - Deleted when the browser exists, contain no expiration date
- Persistent - Expire at a given time
- Secure - Can only be used over HTTPS
- HTTPOnly - Inaccessible from JS
- Also have 3rd party cookies - which are associated with other websites

### Vulnerabilities
Cookie stealing/hijacking - Gaining access to the information stored in a cookie, allowing them to impersonate the user and potentially gain unauthorised access to accounts or data

Cookie poisoning - Modifying or tampering with a cookie, often to inject malicious code or data, which can lead to a variety of security vulnerabilities.

## Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
- Type of injection attack, similar in many ways to an SQL injection
- HTML is read by a browser, and is a combination of content(text) and structure(html tags)
- Can inject html structures into the content of a website, the browser will simply execute these - e.g. `<script>` tags

Reflected XSS - Malicious URL that inserts an exploit directly into the page returned by a server
Persistent XSS - Any website that doesn't properly sanitise html tags from user input is vulnerable. Blog posts with comment sections are obvious targets. 

### Preventing XSS
Websites must aggressively escape HTML characters from *any* user input/output
### Forgery (XSRF)
- When a user puts in an HTTP request, they will also send any relevant session cookies e.g. SID from having logged in
- If the user has already authenticated, a malicious URL can then perform some action on their account
- Can use synchroniser tokens to prevent these kinds of attacks. Each website form has a one-time token that the server validates when the form is submitted

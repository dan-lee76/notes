# TLS and PKI

## SSL/TLS
- TLS is a protocol that provides authenticated and encrypted sessions
- Secure Socket Layer (SSL) came first, then after v3.0 it became Transport Layer Security (TLS)

## TLS
Record Layer - Using established symmetric keys and other session info, will encrypt application packets, much like IPSec.
Handshake Layer - Used to establish session keys, as well as authenticate either party - usually the server using a public-key certificate.

1. **Client and server say hello** - Which TLS version, ciphers, algorithms etc
2. **Pair agree on cipher suit**
3. **Public key verification** - Used to confirm the identity of the server. Certificate includes public key, signature is computed with the private key
4. **Key exchange** - Both parts of a Diffie-Hellman key exchange. Modern TLS uses an elliptic curve version of the scheme. Ephemeral means we do this fresh for every handshake. 
	1. Symmetric keys - Confirm everything has worked safely. Hash function is useful for creating this.
5. **Final checks** - Contains a digest of all the messages in the handshake
6. **Send Application Data** - Switch to regular TLS records for an encrypted session

### 1.3 Improvements
- Major handshake improvements
- All ciphers removed except for modern AEAD
- Key exchange and authentication separated from ciphers
- Wider use of extensions
- 0-RTT Resumption
#### Application Data
- Handshake embeds much of the key exchange into the hello message
- Client guesses a key sharing algorithm within client hello
- If the key share isn't supported, server sends a hello retry request
- Encryption begins after the second msg

#### 0-RTT Resumption
0 During application data, the server can send a pre-shared key for use next time
Doesn't always supply forward secrecy
1-RTT session resumption is closer to the original 1.2 session keys

### Vulnerabilities
- MITM are usually countered using public-key authentication
- The majority of TLS problems are implementation
	- Heartbleed
- Protocol downgrade attacks can be a concern - many servers still allow weak cipher suits

## Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
Key Problem
1. No real reason to trust certificates
2. Have no real reason to trust the signature

### Digital Certificates
- Need trust
- Can use a trusted third party in order to verify the ownership of a public key
- Primarily managed through (PKI)
- Certificates usually held in X509 format

### Issuance
- Server has a public key that they want people to trust
- Server creates a Certificate Signing Request (CSR)
- A Certification Authority (CA) uses this to create and sign a certificate

Server can supply digital signatures using the public key, backed by the certificate when request, during a TLS handshake

### Chain of trust
- Verify the trust in the certificate
- In many cases, the chain involves multiple certificates
- Chains always end in a root certificate, located on the machine

### Management of Root Certificates
- Major OS vendors operate root certificate programs

### Limitations of PKI
- Administrators use it badly - use of wildcard certificates. Poor server setup = low quality ciphers
- Over-reliance on a few key libraries
- Users don't understand it
- Main problem with PKI is that once you've trusted one or more CAs, you trust every certificate signed by them
- If a private key is stolen - the certificate must eb revoked
- Open Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) - Challenge-response in which a CA is polled for live revocation status.

### Alternatives
- Public CA
- Private CA
- Self-signed is bad as harder to deploy and may encourage bad practice

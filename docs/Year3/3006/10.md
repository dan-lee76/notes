# Database Security
- DB Confidentiality - Protection of sensitive data within a DB
- DB Integrity - Data in a DB is accurate, complete, consistent and valid
- DB Availability - Data in a DB is readily available for use when needed

Includes integrity protection to achieve data consistency 
- Internal Consistency - Database entries obey some predefined rules
- External Consistency - Database entries are correct

## SQL Security
Implements access control based on three entities
- Users
- Actions
- Objects
Users invoke actions on objects
Newly created objects are owned by the creator 
Privileges can be granted - Granter, Grantee, Object, Action, Grantable

## View-based security
Views are derived relations
```sql
CREATE VIEW pharm_order AS
SELECT DrugDB.Name, SUM(Total)
FROM Patients, DrugDB
GROUP BY (DrugDB.Name)
WITH CHECK OPTION
```
- They are flexible way of creating policies closer to application requirements
- Can simplify complex queries and enhance data security by restricting direct access to tables
- Data can easily be reclassified
- `INSERT`/`UPDATE` actions depend on CHECK options, else might be blind inserts
- Completeness and consistency are not achieved automatically

## Statistical Database Security
- Use for statistical analysis and generating aggregate data

## Inference
- Due to individual items being sensitive, cannot permit access
- Queries are useful, but by definition refer to the data
- Some queries can reveal information on the underlying data

## Further Defences
- Data swapping - Swap records by keep stats the same
- Noise addition - Alter aggregate output (a little)
- Table splitting - Separate data completely
- User tracking - Log queries

## SQL Injection
- Common for user input to be read and then used within an SQL query
- Unexpected user input can completely rewrite the query
  Bears striking similarities to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks
- Vulnerable if it doesn't filter SQL control characters
	- `'` represents the beginning or end of a string
	- `;` represents the end of a command
	- `/*...*/` represents comments
	- `--` represents a comment for the rest of the line
- UNION appends (not joins) two tables together

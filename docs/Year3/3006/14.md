# Firewalls

- Hardware or software system
- Prevents unauthorised access of packets from one network to another
- All data leaving any subnet must pass through it
- Implements 'single point' security measures
- Event monitoring through packet analysis and logging
- Network-based access control through implementation of a rule set

## Location
Network Firewalls - Placed between a subnet and the internet. Home network
Host-based Firewalls - Placed on individual machines 

## DMZ
- A demilitarized zone is a small subnet that separates externally facing services from the internal network

## More Firewalls
- Not enough, cannot protect against attacks that bypass the firewall (Tunnelling)
- Cannot protect against internal threats or insiders. Might help a bit by egress filtering
- Network firewalls cannot always protect against the transfer of virus-infected programs or files

## Packet Filters
- Specify which packets are allowed or dropped
- Rules based on Source and TCP/UDP port numbers
- Possible for both inbound and outbound traffic
- Can be implemented in a router by only examining packet headers

### Rules
- Rule execution depends on implementation;
	- IPTABLES - First rule to match is applied
	- PF: All rules are examined, the last match is applied
- Rules are organised in chains, which are logical subgroups of rules
- Depending on the packet, different chains are activated

## IPTables
IPTABLES - An application that provides access to the Linux firewall
- Not actually a firewall, but configures the firewall
- The firewall is mostly implemented as *netfilter* modules

IPTABLES uses tables to store chains. Default is the filtering table
- Chains are ordered lists of rules. Match or they don't
- Matches result in a jump, else we check the next rule
- There can be multiple chains per table
- Jumps can go to ACCEPT, DROP, LOG or another chain
- Complex behaviour can be built up

### Defaults
Four built-in tables in IPTABLES:
- Filter
- NAT
- Mangle - Packet Alteration
- Raw - Skips connection tracking
The default table is the filtering table, including Input, Output and Forward chains

### Policies
**Permissive** - Allow everything except dangerous services. Easy to make a mistake
**Restrictive** - Block everything except designated useful services. Easy to DoS yourself.

### Issues
- Filters are simple, low level and have high assurance
- But, they cannot:
	- Prevent attacks that employ application-specific vulnerabilities
	- Do not support higher-level authentication schemes
	- Easy to accidently allow or deny packets incorrectly

## Stateful Packet Filters
- Understand requests and replies (ACK/SYN)
- Dynamically generate rules
- Can support polices for a wider range or protocols

IPTables have modules for stateful packet filtering
ACK packets are used to keep track of the session - the connection is ongoing
Packets without the ACK are the connection establishment messages

## Application-level Gateways
- Packer filters have limited criteria that allow data in and out
- An application gateway considers the application-layer protocol that is in use
- Some protocols, like HTTP and SSH will be allowed, others may be blocked
- Can perform more complex port control than fixed rules

## Proxy Servers
- Imitate a connection on our behalf
- Can block certain access, and scan for malicious files or web pages

### Issues
- Large overhead per connection
- More expensive than packet filtering
- Configuration is complex
- A separate server is required for each service

## Network Address Translation
- The shortage of IP addresses mean that most routers now perform NAT automatically
- The implicit advantage in NAT is that your own machine is almost totally hidden from the internet
- Only established connections are forwarded to your internal machine (or specific port forwarding rules)
- This prevents any unsolicited attacks on random ports, but no other types of attack

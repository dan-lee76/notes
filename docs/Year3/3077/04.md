# Data Encryption Standard (DES)

## Block Ciphers
Encrypt whole block at a time
Size varies, often 64 or 128
More common than stream ciphers

## Pseudorandom Permutations
- Pseudorandom permutation is a function that cannot be distinguished from a random permutation
- Maps a set of values $\{0,1\}^n \times \{0,1\}^8 \to \{0,1\}^n$
	- For any key, the function F is a bijection
	- There is an efficient algorithm to calculate F(x) for all keys and all messages

**Confusion**: Obscure the relationship between plaintext, key and ciphertext (lookup table)
**Diffusion**: Influence of each plaintext and key bit is distributed throughout the ciphertext

## Where to begin
- Confusion is often achieved through substitution
- Diffusion is usually achieved via permutation. Swapping or otherwise mixing bits or bytes

## Feistel Networks
- One mechanism used to create block ciphers
- Developed by Horst Feistel while he worked at IBM
- Underpins DES, GOST, Blowfish, Twofish and numerous other ciphers

### Single Feistel Round
**ADD IMAGE**
- During each round, only half of the block is encrypted
- F is pseudorandom function

### About Feistel Networks
- 1 or 2 rounds is not sufficient

That if **f** is a cryptographically secure pseudorandom function then:
- 3 rounds are sufficient to make a pseudorandom permutation
- 4 rounds are sufficient to make a strong pseudorandom permutation

Balanced Feistel networks: L and R are equal sizes
Unbalanced Feistel networks: L and R can be different sizes

## DES
1972: NBS (now NIST) put out a call for a US standard for encryption
1974: IBM propose DES, built upon a previous family of ciphers developed by Horst Feistel called Lucifer
1976: NBS accepts an altered version of DES following consultation with NSA

64-bit block size
56-bit key
16 rounds

### The `f()` Function

### Expansion
Adds diffusion.
Increases from 32 to 48 bits to match the round key

### Substitution Boxes
Adds confusion
The S-boxes map 6-bit inputs to 4-bit outputs
There are 8 S-boxes in total, each in different

S-boxes need to be highly non-linear
The previous simple systems of linear equations such as we saw in LFSRs
Key design principles
1. No output bit should be too close to a linear combination of input bits
2. 1 bit change input should lead to at least 2 bit output
3. If only the 4 middle bits change, each output must occur exactly once
4. If the first two bits are different but the last two are identical, the output must differ
5. For any non-zero difference in input, no more 8/32 inputs exhibiting this difference should share the same output difference
6. A collision (Zero difference) is only .....


At the end of f(.) is a permutation
This moves bits between S-boxes on the next round

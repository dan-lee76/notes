# Modern Steam Ciphers

Modern stream ciphers use an initial seed key to generate an infinite pseudorandom keystream

## Pseudo Randomness
There are three types of random number generators
- True Random Number Generator (TRNGs) - Impractical at scale
- Pseudorandom Number Generators (PRNGs) - insecure 
- Cryptographically Secure Random Number Generators (CSPRNGs) - Are modern stream ciphers

## LFSR
- A linear-feedback shift register is a register of bits whose positions shift to the right
- Usually comprised of flip-flops, the last bit represents the output

## Mathematical Representation
- Usually represent m-bit LFSRs using polynomials of degree m

## Attacking LFSRs
- Suppose an attacker knows $2m$ plaintext bits
- Step 1 - Calculate key bits
- Step 2 - Reconstruct the LFSR

## Trivium 
LFSRs are much more cryptographically secure if we combine more than one together in a non-linear way
- 3 LFSRs
- Feedback between each with non-linear AND gates
- Initialises the LSFRs with an 80-bit key and 80-bit random value

## ChaCha20
- ChaCha is a stream cipher written by Daniel Berstein
- Modificaiton of a previous cipher, Salsa
- Very lightweight, using only add, xor and rotate operations
- One of two ciphers in TLS1.3

## Vulnerabilities 
- Stream ciphers give us confidentiality, but not integrity
- Must include another mechanism

## Modular Inversion
- In rings and prime fields, multiplicative inverse might exist
- Exists when $gcd(a,p)=1$
- For prime fields, $gcd(a,p)=, \forall a \ne 0 \in GF(p)$

## Euclidean Algorithm
- Calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers
- This is the largest number that divides both $r_0$ and $r_1$

## Bézouts Identity
- Bézouts identity tells us that the greatest common divisor of two numbers can be expressed as the sum of multiples of these numbers

## Extended EA
- Calculates $gcd(r_0,r_1)$ as normal, and in addition calculates values of s and t
- $r_2 = ? \times r_0 + ? \times r_1$

# Digital Signatures

- Application of public key cryptography

## Signatures
- Proof of authenticity of the sender
- Verification is performed by checking the signature against a known signature
- Mostly works for the real world, not very robust
- Does not scale!

## Electronic Signature
- Create a binary signature and append this to any document
- Isn't very secure as anyone can copy this
- In many cases two parties will share a symmetric key $k$
- Non repudiation - Can the signer deny having signed a message

## Message Authentication
**Authenticity** - The sender is confirmed as authentic - only 2 parties have generated the signature
**Integrity** - The signature confirms the message hasn't been altered - better than real-world signature scheme
**Non-Repudiation** - Don't have this - symmetric key means that either parties could have sent the message

## Public Key Signatures
- By using asymmetric cryptography can add non-repudiation to the list of features
- Signing: $x^d mod n$
- Verification $s^e mod n$
- Signing and verification require one use of the square and multiply algorithm
- Efficiency depends on the exponents
- Often keep $e$ small
- This priorities verification speed

## Signature Forgeries
- A forgery is the ability to create a valid message/signature pair($m,s$) where $m$ hasn't previously been signed by the legitimate signer
- E.g. a replay attack using a previous ($m,s$) wouldn't count as a forgery
- Various severities of attack exist depending on the control over the message $m$

## Existential Forgeries
- The attacker is able to create a valid message/ signature pair
- There are no constraints on $m$, it may well be entirely random
- $m$ does not need to be a valid message to be understood by a recipient

## Selective Forgeries
- The attacker is able to create a valid message/signature pair where they have selected $m$ in advance
- $m$ may have some mathematical properties, or be all zeros etc
- It is a requirement that $m$ be fixed prior to the attack

## Universal Forgeries
- The attacker can create a valid signature from any message m
- This is the strongest attack and implies the previous attacks too
- In RSA, this would likely imply that the attacker had obtained the private key

## Existential Forgeries
- An attacker has access to Alice's public key
- They can calculate: $s = random$...
- It is trivial to generate message and signature pairs based on RSA public key

## Malleability
- RSA is also malleable ???
- More control for an attacker than we would like to have for a signature scheme
- Is a weakness of encryption with textbook RSA too

## Padding
- If we enforce rules about valid formatting on m, random messages produced by attackers are unlikely to pass

## Hash-the-sign
- Common to have the message within any padding scheme
- ..
- Verification recomputes the hash:
- ...
- Existential forgeries are much harder - you'd need a random message that's also a valid hash
- Longer messages can be signed, the hash outputs a smaller message digest

## PKCSv1.5
- Modern padding schemes use hashing and padding for security
- Prevents existential forgeries, and attacks on small messages

## RSASSA-PSS
- RSA Signature Scheme with Appendix
- refers to any scheme that sends ($m,s$) separately
- PKCS and similar schemes are deterministic
- The probabilistic signature scheme adds a random salt to the process, meaning repeated signatures on the same document produce different results 

## PSS Encoding
1. Hash message
2. Concatenate padding, has and salt to create $M`$
3. Hash $M`$ into final hash $H$
4. Append padding to salt to create data block $DB$
5. Expand $H$ using $MGF$
6. Calculate $DB$ xor $MGF(H)$ to create maskedDB
7. Output is maskedDB, H and a constant 0xbc

# Steam Ciphers
Steam ciphers encrypt bits one at a time, for as long as it is necessary.
Can have any size of input

Steam ciphers encrypt using modulo 2 addition
Encryption and decryption operations are identical

Modulo 2 - XOR
> Binary operator between two values that returns true if either one input or the other is true, but not both

## Randomness
- The security of a stream cipher depends entirely on the nature of the key stream
- If the stream is truly random, the output is truly random
## True Randomness (TRNG)
- Impossible to recreate except by chance (e.g. coin flips)
- Computer systems often use hardware sources for randomness
- How can someone generate a key if its truly random, would have to be sent over the internet

## Pseudo Randomness (PRNGs)
- Generate a sequence of values based on a seed
- Usually the only requirement is statistical randomness
- Super fast
- Linear congruential generator

## CSPRNGs
- PRNGs whose output is unpredictable
- ...
- Given $n$ bits of keystream, can we predict the next bit $x$?
- What do we assign epsilon $\epsilon$. ($1/2^{32}$)

## Unconditional Security
**Unconditional Security** - A cryptosystem is unconditionally or information-theoretically secure if it cannot be broken even with infinite computational resources

**Perfect Secrecy** - The ciphertext should reveal no information about the plaintext 

## The One Time Pad (OTP)
- Key stream $s_0,s_1,s_2,...$ generated by a TRNG
- Key stream is known only to the communicating parties
- Every key stream bit $s_i$ is used only once

- Any plaintext is equally likely depending on the key
- Example where $M=C-K (mod 26)$

OTP is not practical
- 1gb file would need 1gb key
- How are we transporting and storing the keys
- If you ever reuse a key, the entire cipher is broken

## Modern Stream Ciphers
- Modern stream ciphers use an initial seed key to generate an infinite pseudorandom keystream
- Stream ciphers use a nonce value to alter the keystream for a given key
- This allows us to create different keystreams for a given key

## Number Used Once (NONCE)
- Vital for stream cipher security
- Instead of always using a unique key, the security requirement is you always use a unique (key + nonce) pair
- Nonces are not secret - they are public random seed for a key stream

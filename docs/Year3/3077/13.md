# Elliptic Curves

Find another type of group and operation in which the DLP is hard

$ax^2+by^2=r^2$
- By curves here, really mean the set of points that are solutions to the equations
- Elements on these curves are real numbers
- Consider the points in Zp

For DLP problem, need a cyclic group
- Elements within the group 
- A group operation
For ECs the elements are points on the curve
The operation is point addition


## Point Addition
$$P+Q=R$$
- Any line through two points intersects a third point
- Reflect this point about the x-axis
## Point Doubling
$$P+P=2P$$
- The tangent at a point will intersect another point on the curve
- Reflect this point about the x-axis
## Group Laws
$$2P+P=3P$$
$$3P+P=4P$$
$$2P+2P=4P$$
## Point Addition Equations
- Can derive equations for this based on the equation for a line that intersects the curve in three places


...???

## The Point at Infinity
- The point at infinity is the neutral element on an elliptic curve
- In practice the point doesn't have coordinates, and cant be used within the normal formula.
- When implementing have to detect when the x values are equal and y values are inverses mod p


## Cyclic Groups
- Points on an elliptic curve including the neutral element O form cyclic subgroups
- Under certain conditions all points form a cyclic group

# Historical Ciphers

Ciphers have been used for thousands of years
Usually based around either transportation or substitution

Everything about an algorithm is public

## Caesar Cipher
- Early substitution cipher, replace each letter of plaintext with a shifted letter further down the alphabet.
- Caesar always used a key $k = 3$

## Modular Arithmetic
- System of arithmetic for finite sets of integers (own rules)
- Common infinite sets include
- $\N = \{1,2,3,...\}$
- $\Z = \{...,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,...\}$
- $Q,R,C$
...
The congruence relation:
$a \equiv r (mod  m)$
can be written as 
$a=q \times m + r$

...

## Integer Rings
Module arithmetic forms what in Mathematics we would call a Ring
### Def
The integer ring $z$ consists of
1. The set ...
2. Two operations ...

...

## Affine Cipher
Multiple the letters by a number, then shift them

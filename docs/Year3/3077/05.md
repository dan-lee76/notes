# DES and Cryptanalysis

Key is 48 bits, not 64 as NSA found it too difficult to

Key Schedule - The DES key schedule simply returns various permutations of $k$ as sub-keys

`<<<` - left rotation
`>>>` - right notation

## PC-1
- Permuted Choice 1 - Selects 56 of the 64 bits
- The other "parity" bits are discarded: DES only uses a 56-bit key
- Spread throughout the internal state of the key schedule
- DES was good the hardware back in the day

## Left Rotations
- Represent a left shift where the left most numbers wrap around to the right hand side
- In DES, each 28-bit block is rotated left by `<<<1` for rounds {1,2,9,16} and `<<<2` otherwise
- The total rotation is $4\times 1+ 12\times 2 = 28$ which means $C_0=C_{16}$ and $D_0=D_{16}$

**PC-2** - Permuted choice 2 select 48 of the 56 bits to be used as keys
## Breaking DES
Des has a key length of 56-bits
A brute force attack requires no knowledge of the cipher, only a pair of plaintext and ciphertext

Key collisions - For a 56-bit key but a 64-bit block its possible a different key could work, but unlikely

## Meet-in-the-middle
Attack splits the search space into two
1. Calculate encryptions of $x_1$ for all $k_{L,i}$ and store intermediate values $Z_{L,i}$
2. Calculate all decryptions of $y_1$ for all $k_{R,j}$ to find $Z_{R,j}$

### Practicalities
- Requires $2^{k+1}$ attempts rather than $2^{k\times2}$
- Much better than the brute force attempt
- Trades off computation for storage
- Assumes some king of O(1) lookup

## 3DES
- Triple DES uses three different keys
- Either enc->enc->enc or enc->dec->enc (is backwards compatible)
- Often used in banking, smart cards and other payment systems
- 3 times slower than AES, and less secure
## DES-X
- Key whitening
- Taking first key, xoring with input, then encrypt with 2nd key, then xor with 3rd key 
- MITM can still be used here, as well as other more advanced 

## Cryptanalysis
Types of attacks:
- Brute-force
- Ciphertext-only
- Known-plaintext
- Chosen-plaintext
- Chosen-ciphertext
- Related-key attack

In modern cryptography, a cipher is declared broken by any attack that is more efficient than brute force

Analytical Attacks - Exploit some underlying structural or mathematical weakness in a cipher
- e.g. MITM
- Derivation of taps in LFSRs

Statistical Attacks - Capture statistical patterns between input and output to recover key bits
- Differential cryptanalysis
- Linear cryptanalysis

## Differential Cryptanalysis
- Perhaps ow the most important modern method for breaking block ciphers
- It is a chosen plaintext attack
- Aim to find predictable changes in output bits caused by known changes in input bits

### Resisting 
- S-boxes must be designed such that the probability of any pair is as low as possible
- More rounds make differentials even less likely
- Good permutation to involve more S-boxes is vital
- DES was specifically designed to resist this kind of attack - in secret

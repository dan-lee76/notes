# Diffie-Hellman

- Two parties can jointly agree a shared secret over an insecure channel
- Mathematically, both calculating the same value mod a prime p
- $p$ 600+ decimal digits
- The parties separately compute the same key, rather than share it

## Groups
1. Operation is closed
2. Operation is associative
3. Neutral element
4. Each $a \in G$ called a neutral element such that ...
5. A group $G$ is abelian (commutative)

$\Z^*_n$ consists of the integers 1,2,..,n-1 for which $gcd(i,n)=1$ . This set forms an abelian group under multiplicative n

## Group Cardinality
- The cardinality of a group is the number of elements in that group
$$|\Z^*_p|=p-1$$
## Cyclic Groups
... 

- A group that contains an element $g$ of maximum order is called a cyclic group
- Any element of maximum order is called a primitive root, or generator

### Subgroups
- For all primes, ..., is an abelian finite cyclic group
- Will always be a size of 1,2,5 or 10
## Order of an element


## Cracking
- Brute force: $O(|G|)$
- Shanks Baby-Step Gian-Step: $O(\sqrt{|G|})$  and ~$~ \sqrt{|G|}$
- Pollards Rho: $O(\sqrt{|G|})$ 
- Pohlig-Hellman: Prime factorisation of $|G|$
	- Discrete log problem is solved mod each prime factor and the results combined using the Chinese remainder theorem
- Index Calculus directly attacks .. and is the reason EC is so much more efficient

## Which prime?
- To avoid unexpected small subgroup attacks, DH primes are safe primes
- A safe prime is a prime $p$ where $(p-1)/2$ is also prime

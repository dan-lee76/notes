# Elliptic Curve Cryptosystems

## Cyclic Groups
- Each group includes the point at infinity

## Points vs Integers
- Important to remember the distinction between points on the curve, and integer values
- On Elliptic curves, private keys such as a are integers
- Generators and public keys are points (x,y)

## Group Cardinality
- Size of cyclic groups is very important to the security
- While easy to calculate for modular arithmetic, the number of points on a given elliptic curve is not so obvious
- Might imagine that a curve would have $2p+1$ points, in reality it is fewer than this
- Hasse's theorem states that for a curve $E$ over a field $\Z_p$ the number of elements  `#E` is bounded by....

# `#E`
- Large `#E` is very important to prevent various attacks on ECDLP
- Calculating it exactly is hard, it can be done with Shoofs algorithm
- Various properties of `#E` enable or restrict certain attacks

## How hard is ECDLP
- GA like Pollards Rho and Pohlig-Hellman that are applicable to any category of DLP
- These generic attacks mean curves and parameters should be chosen with care
- Most powerful attack on modular arithmetic based DLP is Index Calculus. Modern cryptosystems must use >2000 bit keys
- Index calculus does not work on Elliptic Curves, so they need to remain secure against generic attacks

## Efficient Computation
- No natural way of calculating $a\times P$

## Implementation
### Point Compression
- Do not need to transport full (x,y) coords as know the formula
- Each point contains a unique $x$, and one of two $y$ values where ...
- Most implementations will use the full $x$ value, and append a single bit representing a positive or negative $y$ value
### Projective Coordinates
- Some implementations adjust the formula to point addition to use projective coordinates (x,y,z) rather than (x,y)
- Curve sits on the plane $z=1$
- Point at infinity O=(0,1,0)
### Standard Curves
- Choice of curve parameters influence both security and efficiency of cryptosystems based around ECs
- Never use a randomly generated curve
- Standard curves exist in various forms
	- Varied equations
	- Different implementation methods
	- Different choices of prime

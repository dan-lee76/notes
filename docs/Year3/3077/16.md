# Elgamal Encryption
- Extension of diffie-helman


## Elgamal
- Develop by Taher Elgamal in 1985
- As this is a public key encryption, can make some efficiency savings by not sending all the information both ways every time
- If ...

## Computational Efficiency
- Both the exponentiations during encryption can be pre-computed during downtime
- Can also improve on the decryption step using Fermats little theorem

## Practicalities
- Elgamal is a probabilistic encryption scheme. Uses an ephemeral key pair a and k_E and ...
- .....


## DSA
- Based on Elgamal, developed by NIST as an alternative to RSA
- Computed in a subgroup of prime orders q, which is usually 160 bits
- Means the signature (r,s) is 320 bits
- Hashing is enforced by the algorithm, and a hash function must match the key size
- Index calculus does not apply to the sub-group, so 160 bit DSA signatures have a security of 80 bits
- In practice larger keys would be required now

## ECDSA
- Identical to DSA, operates on an elliptic curve over $Z_p$ with the signature calculated over a large subgroup of prime order $#q$
- More efficient, does not require modulus of thousands of bits
- Security level is based on generic attacks against EC
- Deterministic generation of k is often used for security
- Other variants like EdDSA using Edwards curves

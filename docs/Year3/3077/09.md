# Modes of operation
Mode of operation is the configuration used around a block cipher

- Most messages don't come in convenient 128-bit block lengths
- Need to run a block cipher repeatedly on consecutive blocks
- Stream Cipher have been proven harder to implement. ChaCha20 is pretty good. Have been massively broken

## Padding
- ECB and some other modes require message length to be a multiple of the block size
- Public Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS7) is a common padding scheme:
1.  Padding bytes are always added to the plaintext before it is encrypted
2. Each padding byte had a value equal to the total number of padding bytes that are added
3. The total number of padding bytes is at least one

## Electronic Code Block (ECB)
Just encrypt each block one after another
(Never do this)

### Weakness
- ECB allows an attacker to infer information on the plaintext
- ECB divulges whenever messages or blocks are the same

## Deterministic vs Probabilistic Encryption
- An encryption scheme is deterministic if some plaintext is mapped to a fixed ciphertext if the key is unchanged
- ECB is deterministic, but most modern modes of operation are probabilistic
- Probabilistic encryption schemes add randomness to the encryption process to achieve a non-deterministic generation of the cipher text
## Cipher Block Chaining (CBC)
- XOR the output of each cipher block with the next input
- IV: Initialisation Vector
### Decryption
- Similar, but the XOR now takes place after decryption
- Easier to parallelise
### Weakness
- Was the primary method of encryption for many years, now less common

## Padding Oracles
- Oracle is a system we can query and it will tell us if, once decrypted, some text has valid padding
- System is unlikely to tell you directly, but it might give away some clues

### Attacks
- Attack is essentially the same for multiple blocks, just one at a time
- Attack the last block, which contains padding

## Counter Mode (CTR)
Encrypt a nonce + counter and use this to mask the plaintext with XOR
- This is very easily parallelised 
- Each block is encrypted differently, avoiding the issue with ECB mode

## Galois Counter Mode
- Extends the counter mode to add authenticity
	- Sender definitely sent that message, and it hasn't changed
- Very similar to counter mode, but adds an authentication tag
	- Uses multiplication in a Galois Finite field ....
- Extremely parallelisable
- Robust to message alteration

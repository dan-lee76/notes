# RSA - Key Generation Encryption

## Introduction
- Introduced in 1977
- Most popular public key algorithm in the world
- Not used for encryption. Mainly for digital signatures
- Keys are usually 2048
- Security is built around the difficulty of factoring large numbers

## Encryption 
- Encryption performed by the public key can only be reversed using the private key
### Key Transport
- Historically RSA was often used to encrypt session keys 
## Signatures
- The authenticity of signatures generated by the private key can be verified by the public key

## Euler Totient Function
- Number of integers for in $Z_m$ for which $gcd(a,m)=1$

## Integer Factorisation
- Any integer can be expressed as the multiplication of a list of prime numbers
- The longer the value, the harder (and slower) this gets

## Fermats Little Theorem
- States that for some prime p and any integer a:
$a^{p-1}== 1 (mod m)$

## Key Generation
1. Choose two large primes, $p$ and $q$
2. Calculate the modulus $m=p\times q$
3. Calculate ... 
4. Choose a value $\ep \in {2,...}$ where gcd...=1
5. Compute $d$ where $d\times e \eq 1 (mod...)$

# 65537
- Largest known number of the from $2^{2^n} +1$
- Primes of this form are known as Fermat Primes
- Very useful public exponent for RSA

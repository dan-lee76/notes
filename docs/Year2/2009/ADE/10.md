# 10.  Master Theorem
_06/03/23_

Consider recurrence relations of the form $T(n) = a T(n/b) + f(n)$
- Designed for *divide and conquer* in which problems are divided into a instances of a problem of size $n/b$
- Aim is to be quickly express the big-Oh family behaviour of T(n) for various cases of the values of a and b, and the scaling behaviour of f(n)
- No proof needed, just need to learn it and how to apply it

## Cases
 $T(n) = a T(n/b) + f(n)$
 Results are split into 3 cases, according to comparing the growth rate of f(n) to $n^{(\log_{b}{a})}$ 
 - Case 1: $f(n)$ *grows slower*. Recurrence term dominates. (Solution ignores f)
 - Case 2: $f(n)$ grows same - up to log factors - *mix of recurrence with $a,b$, and also the $f(n)$ term*
 - Case 3: $f(n)$ grows faster. *Solution ignores recurrence terms and $a,b$*

# 17. Basics of Graphs

- A graph is a set of *nodes*, or *vertices*, connected by edges
- Graphs can be used to represent; networks, flow charts etc
- **Directed** - Edges have direction
- **Undirected** - Edges don't have direction. Can be represented as directed graphs where for each edge there is a corresponding edge
- **Weighted** - Edges have weights
- **Unweighted** - 
- **Cycle** - Path from a vertex to itself
- **Acyclic** - If it does not have cycles

## Implementation of graph
- Several approaches, but most common options are: 
	- Static indexed data structure "Adjacency Matrix"
	- Dynamic data structure "Adjacency Lists"
### Adjacency Matrix
- Store node in an array - each node is associated with an integer (array index)
- Represent information about the edges using a 2d array where `array[i][j] == 1`
- For weighted graphs, place weights in the matrix
#### Disadvantages
- Sparse graphs with few edges for number that are possible result in many zero entries in adjacency matrix
	- Wastes space and makes many algorithms less efficient
- Also, if the number of nodes in the graph may change, matrix representation is too inflexible

### Adjacency List
- For every vertex, keep a list of adjacent vertices
- Keep a list of vertices, or keep vertices in a Map as keys and lists of adjacent vertices as values

## Spanning Tree
- Input: Connected, undirected graph
- Output: A tree which connects all vertices in the graph using only the edges present in the graph
### Minimum Spanning Tree
- Input: Connected, undirected, weighted graph
- Output: A spanning tree. 
	- Connects all vertices in the graph using only the edges present in the graph
	- Minimum is the sense that the sum of weights of the edges in the smallest possible for any spanning tree

# 5. Big-Oh Family (2)

## $Î˜$ is an equivalence relation
- Any relation that is Reflexive, Symmetric and Transitive
- is an equivalence relation
- Behaves like a equality

## Little-Oh - Definition
Definition - Given (positive) functions $f(n)$ and $g(n)$ we say that 
$$f(n) == o(g(n))$$
if for all positive (real) constants $c>0$ there exists $n_0$ such that
$f(n) < cg(n)$ for all $n\ge n_0$

### Usage rules
- Cam also do multiplication:
- $f1$ is $o(g1)$, $f2$ is $o(g2)$ implies $f1*f2$ is $o(g1*g2)$

## Mnemonics
- **Big-Oh** - Less than or equal $\le$ 
- **Big-Omega** - Greater than or equal $\ge$
- **Big-Theta** - Equal $=$
- **little-oh** - Strictly less than $<$

## Asymptotic Algorithm Analysis
- The asymptotic analysis of an algorithm determines the running time in big-Oh notation
- To perform the asymptotic analysis
	- We find the worst-case number of primitive operations executed as a function of the input size
	- We express this function with big-Oh notation
- Since constant factors and lower-order terms are eventually dropped anyhow, we can disregard them when counting primitive operations

## Caveats & Cautions
- Point of big-Oh-family is that it can hide constants and lower-order terms; but sometimes these are important
- Worst case might happen too rarely to matter

# 18. Shortest Paths & Dijkstras


## Floyd-Warshall (FW)

- Suppose that wanted to find the shortest path between all pairs of start and end nodes
	- We would run Dijkstra from every node
	- Would then be a factor of $O(|V|)$ worse than Dijkstra
- But may be better to run a specific algorithm

### All-Paris SPs
- The basic method has similarities to the methods for "change giving"
- "Build the optimal answers using a subset of the nodes. Then add the effects of other nodes one at a time"

#### Data Structure
d(i,j,k) 
- Shortest distance between nodes i and j
- But using only the nodes {1,...,k} as potential allowed intermediary points

### Initialisation of data structure
d(i,j,0) = best distance between nodes i and j, but not using any intermediate nodes,
so only using a singe edge, Hence
d(i,j,0) = w(i,j) if there is an edge i to j = Inf otherwise

# 6. Linked Lists & Simple Sorting Algorithms
_20/02/23_

## Linked Lists
- A singly linked list is a concrete data structure consisting of a sequence of nodes.
- Each node stores elements
- In a simple linked list, all the data is accessible from the head by just *walking along the list*.

### Doubly Linked List
- Provides a natural extension on a singly linked list
- Nodes store: element, link to next node and link to previous mode
- **Deletion at the tail is now O(1)**, but this uses more memory

## Simple Sorting Algorithms
### Bubble Sort
- Often are equal with respect to the desired ordering but not necessarily that they have the same contents. One example is excel spreadsheets
- Time complexity is $t((n-1)+(n-2)+...+1)$. Worst case is $O(n^2)$

### Selection Sort
- Similar to bubble sort; on each scan instead of always try to move the 'greatest element so far' immediately, we just remember its location and move it at end can
- Same number of iterations, same number of comparisons in the worst case. Fewer swaps (one for each outer loop = n-1)

### Insertion Sort
- Keep the front of the list sorted, and we move through the back, elements we insert them into the correct place in the front
- In the worst case, has to make $n(n-1)/2$ comparisons and shifts to the right. Also $O(n^2)$. Best case is the array is already sorted. Becomes $O(n)$

### Adaptive Sort
- Complexity for when the lists are already 'nearly sorted'
- In many applications lists might already be close to being sorted

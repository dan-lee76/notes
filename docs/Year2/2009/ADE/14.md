# 14. Map ADT and hashtables
_20/03/23_

## Hack Tables (hash maps)
- Are concrete data structure which is suitable for implementing maps
- **Basic idea: convert each key into an index into a (big) array**
- Look-up of keys and insertion and deletion in a hash table usually runs in O(1) time.
	- Not guaranteed, and design of the table needs to be done carefully if want the access to be 'reliably O(1)'

### Hash Functions
- A hash function $h$ maps keys of a given type to integers in a fixed interval.
- Integer $h(k)$ is called the hash value of key $k$
- Hash table for a given key type consists of 
	- Hash function $h$
	- Array of size $N$
- When implementing a map with a hash table, the goal is to store them at index $i=h(k)$

### Collision Handling
- Collisions occur when different elements are mapped to the same cell
- A lot of the theory and practice of hashing consists of devising better ways to avoid or handle collisions
### Hash Functions
- Hash function is usually specified as the composition of two functions:
- Hash Code: $h_1:$ keys $\to$ integers
- Compression Function: $h_2:$ integers $\to [0,N-1]$
- Hash code is applied first, and the compression function is applied next on the result
- Goal of the hash function is to disperse the keys in an apparently random way

#### Dispersal
- Reduce numbers of collision
- Random means to pattern
- If there is an obvious pattern then the incoming data might have a matching pattern that leads to many collisions

### Compression Functions
Division:
- $h_2(y)=y \mod N$ 
- Size $N$ of the hash table is usually chosen to be a prime

Multiple, Add and Divide (MAD)
- $h_2(y)=(ay+b)\mod N$
- $a$ and $b$ are non-negative integers 

### Collision Handling
- Collisions occur when different elements are mapped to the same cell
- **Separate Chaining**: Let each cell in the table point to (e.g.) a linked list of entries that map there

## Map Methods with separate chaining used for collisions
???

## Separate chaining
- Simple and fast, but requires additional memory outside the table
- When memory is critical then we try harder to remain within the existing memory

### Open Addressing
> The colliding item is placed in a different cell of the table

- **Linear Probing** - Handles collisions by placing the colliding item in the next (circularly) available table cell (variant: cell + c where c is a constant)
- Each table cell inspected is referred to as a "probe"
- Disadvantage: Colliding items lump together, causing future collisions to cause a longer sequence of probes

### Search with linear probing
Consider a hash table $A$ that uses linear probing
`get(k)`
- Start at cell `h(k)`
- Probe consecutive locations until one of the following occurs
	- An item with key $k$ is found or 
	- An empty cell is found or
	- $N$ cells have been unsuccessfully probed

### Double Hashing
- Uses a secondary hash function $d(k)$ and handles collisions by placing an item in the first available cell of the series
- Secondary hash function $d(k)$ cannot have zero values
- Linear probing is just $d(k)=1$
- Table size $N$ must be a prime to allow probing of all the cells

## Performance of Hashing
- In the worst case, searches, insertions and removals on a hash table take $O(n)$ time
- The worst case occurs when all the keys inserted into the map collide
- The load factor $\alpha=n|N$ affects the performance of a hash table
- Expected running time of all the map ADT operations in a hash table is $O(1)$
- Hashing is very fast provided the load factor is not close to 100%

## Re-Hashing
- When table is too full, then re-hash.
- Create a new larger table and new hash function
- Have to transfer all the entries from the old table to the new one

## Applications
- Small databases
- Compilers
- Browser cache 

## Comparison of HashMap and PQ
- Does not use the ordering of keys
- PQ does not allow direct access to a key

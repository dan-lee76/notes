# 11. The Vector Data Type, and Amortised Analysis
_10/03/23_

## Vector ADT
The *Vector* is an ADT, corresponding to generalising the notion of the *Array*
Key Ideas:
- The "index" of an entry in an array can be though of as the "number of elements preceding it"
- E.g. in an array A, then A[2] has two elements, A[0], A[1] that precede it
- It is then called a "rank"
- The notion of "rank" can be more general than the idea of index

- The Vector ADT is based on the array CDT, and stores a sequence of arbitrary objects
- An element can be accessed, inserted or removed by specifying its rank (number of elements preceding it)
- An exception is thrown if an incorrect rank is specified

### Vector as a Stack
- Common usage of a Vector is as a Stack
	- Add and remove elements at the end
- This is very useful if reading elements from a file, and not knowing how many there will be

### Applications
- There is not an automatic limit on the storage size
- Direction applications - sorted collection of objects
- Indirect applications - Auxiliary data structure for many algorithms. Components of other data structures

- **Array-based Vector** - Operation `elemAtRank(r)` is implemented in $O(1)$ time by returning $V[r]$
- **Insertion** - Need to make room for the new element by shifting forward the $n-r$ elements. In the worst case $(r=0)$, this takes $O(n)$ time
- **Deletion** - Need to fill the hole left by removed element by shifting backward the $n-r-1$ elements. In the worst case $(r=0)$ this takes $O(n)$ time

### Performance
- Space used by the data structure is $O(n)$
- `size`, `isEmpty`, `elemAtRank` and `replaceAtRank` run in $O(1)$
- `insertAtRank` and `removeAtRank` run in $O(n)$ time
- `push` runs in $O(1)$ time, as do not need to move elements
- `pop` runs in $O(1)$ time

## Growable Array-based Vector
- When the array is full, instead of throwing an exception, can replace the array with a larger one. Resizing has a high cost of $O(n)$, as needs to copy at all $n$ elements
- Compare the incremental strategy and the doubling strategy by analysing the total time $T(n)$ needed to perform a series of $n$ push operations
- Call amortized time of a push operation the average time taken by a push over the series of operations $T(n)/n$

### Amortize
Meaning - Refers to writing off, or paying off, debts over a period of time. Similar to the way a mortgage for a house is paid back over many years, as opposed to need to pay all in one go.

### Remarks on Amortised Analysis
- Suppose individual operation takes time $T$ in the worst-case
- Suppose do a sequence of operations:
	- Suppose s such operations take total time $T_s$
	- Then $sT$ is an upper-bound to the total time $T_s$
	- But, such an upper-bound might not ever occur
- The time $T_s$ might well be $o(sT)$ even in the worst-case
	- The average time per operation $T_s/s$ can be the most relevant quantity in practice

Amortised - (long) real sequence of dependent operations
Average - Set of (possibly independent) operations

### Describing amortised costs
- Usual big-Oh family is still used to described amortised analysis
- Have different measures of the runtime cost:
	- Worse case - *Cost per operation of a sequence not just worst case of a single operation*

## Incremental Strategy Analysis
- Replace the array $k=n/c$ times
- Each "replace" costs the current size
- The total time $T(n)$ of a series of $n$ push operations is proportional to
- $n+c+2c+3c+...+kc=n+c(1+2+3+...+k)=n+ck(k+1)/2$
- Since $c$ is a constant, $T(n)$ is $O(n+k^2)$, i.e. $O(n^2)$
- The amortized time of a push operation is $O(n)$
- This is bad as the normal cost of a push is $O(1)$

## Doubling Strategy Analysis
- Assume n is a power of 2. Replace the array $k=\log_2n$ times
- The total time $T(n)$ of a series of $n$ push operations is proportional to
- $n+1+2+3+4+8+...+2^{k-1}$

Sometimes have to use geometric sequences. Have to set $T(n)$ is $O(n)$ and end up doing  induction.

# 9. Recurrence Relations
_03/03/23_

## Recurrence Relations
- Is a recursively-defined function. Applied to the case when the function is some measure of resources, might only want the big-Oh family properties of the solution
- Suppose that the runtime of a program is T(n), then a recurrence relation will express T(n) in terms of its values at other (smaller) values of n


## Simple Sorting
- Bubble sort do not naturally generate recurrence relations as they are not naturally recursive
- But could be phrased that way, bubble sort, $T(n)=T(n-1)+d n$
	- $dn$ for a pass on the outer loop
	- $T(n-1)$ for the remaining passes

## Solving Recurrence
General Pattern
1. Starting from the base case, use the recurrence to work out many cases, by directly substituting and working upwards in values of n
2. Inspect the results, look for a pattern and make a hypothesis for the general results
3. Attempt to prove the hypothesis - typically using some form of induction
Often then extract the large $n$ behaviour using big-Oh family. Can be long, tedious and error prone, but many cases are covered by a general rule with the name of "Master Theorem"

# 16.  Heuristics and dynamic programming

## General Methods
Various general methods (paradigms) for finding solutions to problems
Common ones includes:
- Brute force - "generate and test"
- Divide-and-conquer
- Heuristics
- Dynamic Programming

### Brute Force
- Roughly generate and test
	- Generate all potential solutions
	- Test for which ones are actual solutions
- Can be useful in some (small) cases

### Divide and Conquer
- Recursively, break the problem into smaller pieces, solve them, and put them back together
- Merge-sort and quick sort are classic example

### Heuristics
- Heuristic = rule of thumb
- Generally, mean to mean something that gives better decisions, than the naive methods, but still not necessarily optimal
- Two common type (the term is over-loaded)
	- Decisions within a procedure that gives exact/optimal answers are designed to make it go faster
	- Decisions within a procedure that might not give optimal answers, but are designed to give good answers that are impractical to obtain otherwise

#### In exact methods
- General methods that works in an algorithm that does give exact or optimal answers
	- But need the heuristics to decrease the (average/typical) runtime
	- Examples = Admissible heuristic in A* search
#### Inexact Methods
- These are general methods that (generally) are not be guaranteed to give the best possible answer, but that can give good answers quickly
- Used on problems when the exact methods are too slow
- It is a vast research area

### Greedy Algorithms
- Common heuristic is to be greedy
- Take the decision that looks best in the short term - without looking ahead

#### Optimal
- Sometimes greedy algorithms can still give optimal answers
- Prims algorithm for constructing a minimal spanning tree is a greedy algorithm:
	- Just adds the shortest edge without worrying about the overall structure, without looking ahead
	- Makes a locally optimal choice at each step
	- Turns out that this is sufficient for the final answer to be optimal

#### Non-optimal
- Usually greedy algorithms cannot guarantee to give optimal answers
- Often still give (nearly) optimal answers in practice

## Dynamic Programming
- DP is a general method that can be suitable when the optimal solutions satisfy a decomposition property
- General idea is roughly:
	- Splitting an optimal solution into sub-solutions corresponds to splitting the problem into sub-problems and the sub-solutions are optimal for the sub-problems
	- So optimal solutions can be built out of optimal solutions of (smaller) sub-problems
	- Hence: *solve small sub-problems first, then build up towards the full solution*

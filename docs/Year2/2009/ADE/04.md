# 4. The Big-Oh family
_13/02/23_

## Big-Omega
Given functions $f(n)$ and $g(n)$ we say that 
$$f(n) == \Omega(g(n))$$
if there are (strictly) positive constants $c$ and $n_0$ such that 
$f(n) \ge cg(n)$ for all $n\ge n_0$


Grows at least as fast as g(n) at large n

It is reflexive, **NOT** symmetric but is transitive

### Linking big-Oh and big-Omega
Omega expresses 'grows as least as fast as'
Oh expresses 'grows at most as fast as'

## Big-Theta
Given functions $f(n)$ and $g(n)$ we say that 
$$f(n) == \Theta(g(n))$$
if there are positive constants $c',c'',n_0$ such that 
$f(n) \le c' g(n)$
$f(n) \gt c'' g(n)$
for all $n\ge n_0$ 

Big Theta is an equivalence relation. Behaves like a equality

# 15. Maps - Using binary search trees
_24/03/23_

## Note intended to help with coding
- Global view of tree
	- Can look at entire tree in one go
	- Human seeing a picture of a (small) tree
- Local view of tree
	- What your code sees: "code perspective"
	- Code generally only sees a local portion of a tree and must work with that

## Binary Search
- Search for an element within a sorted array is fast
	- Array to be searched is halved at each iteration, hence $O(\log n)$
- Only works because of the step of knowing whether to go left or right
- But arrays suffer from being slow, $O(n)$, to insert new elements. As needs to shift $O(n)$ elements to make room for them
- Search trees attempt to fix the inefficiency of insertion whilst keeping good $O(\log n)$ properties of binary search

## Binary Search Trees
- Binary search tree is a binary tree storing key-value entries at its internal nodes and satisfying the following "search tree" property:
	- Let $u$, $v$, and $w$ be any three nodes such that $u$ is in the left subtree of $v$ and $w$ is in the right subtree of $v$;
	- $key(u)\le key(v) \le key(w)$
- External nodes do not store items, and likely are not actually implemented, but are just null links from the parent

### Search
- To search for the key $k$, trace a downward path starting at the root
- The next node visited depends on the outcome of the comparison of $k$ with the key of the current node
- If we reach a leaf, the key is not found and we return null

#### Recursive vs. Iterative
- Recursive programs are easier to implement, but less efficient because of the overhead of a function call
- For best efficiency, will need to convert to an iterative program
- `while (test) {...}`

Fundamental property of search tree - An inorder traversal of a (binary) search trees visits the keys in increase order. To access the minimum key, just need to 'always go left'

### Insertion
- Insert $k$ where a `get(k)` would find it.
- If $k$ is already in tree then just replace the value, otherwise, $k$ is not already in the tree, and let $w$ be the leaf reached by the search
### Deletion
- We remove $n$ from the tree and connect it to the parent. Still works if $n$ is a right child and has a left child
- For removing one with two children:
	1. Find the internal node $w$ that follows $n$ in an inorder traversal
	2. Copy $key(w)$ into node $n$
	3. Remove node $w$ and its left child $z$ (must be a leaf) by means of same procedure as before for *one child*

## Balanced Trees
- Binary search trees: if all levels filled, then search, insertion and deletion are $O(\log N)$
- However performance may deteriorate to linear if nodes are inserted in order
### Performance
- Binary search tree of height $h$ with $n$ items. The space used is $O(n)$. Methods take $O(h)$
- The height $h$ is $O(n)$ in the worst case and $O(\log n)$ in the best case

### Self-Balancing
- Constantly re-structure of trees:
- Keep the trees height balanced so that the height is logarithmic in the size
- Performance always logarithmic

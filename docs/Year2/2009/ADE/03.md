# 3. Big-O (2)
_10/02/23_

## Classification of Functions
Often need a way to group together functions by their scaling behaviour, and the classification should
- Remove unnecessary details
- Be (relatively) quick and easy
- Be able to deal with weird functions that can happen to runtime
- Still be mathematically well-defined

## Ratios vs. big-Oh
- $f(n)$ can be $O(g(n))$ even if the ratio $f(n)/g(n)$ does not exist
- Therefore, big-Oh can be used in situations that ratios cannot
- The possibility of 'weird functions' means that big-Oh is more suitable than ratios for doing analysis of efficiency of programs

- Is reflexive -> Any function $f(n)$ is $O(f(n))$
- Is NOT symmetric -> 1 is O(n) but n is not O(1)
- Is transitive ->
- As a set 




## Multiplication Rule

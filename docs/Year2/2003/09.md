# 9. Monads IV
_06/03/23_

## Monanic Version of map
```haskell
mapm :: Monad m => (a -> m b) -> m[b]
mapm f [] = return []
mapm f (x:xs) = do y <- f x
					ys <- mapm f xs
					return (y:ys)
```

```haskell
conv :: Char -> Maybe Int
conv c | isDigit c = Just (digitToInt c)
	   | otherwise = Nothing
```

```haskell
concat :: [[a]] -> [a]
concat xss = [x | xs <- xss, x <- xs]

join :: Monad m => m (m a) -> m a
join mmx = do mx <- mmx
				x <- mx
				return x
```


## Monad Laws
`return x >>= f = ?`
Goal is to figure out what type should be at `?`

`return x >>= f = f x`

### Right hand side
`mx >>= return = mx`

### Bind operator with itself
Associativity property 
```haskell
(mx >>= f) >>= g
=
mx >>= (\x -> (f x >>= g))
```

These are fundamental properties for monads

## Effectful Programming

| Type           | Effect         |
| -------------- | -------------- |
| `a -> Maybe b` | Exceptions     |
| `a -> [b]`     | Non-dertminism |
| `a -> ST b`    | Internal State |
| `a -> IO b`    | Input/Output   |


## Whats the point of monads?
1. Supports pure programming with effects
2. Use of monads is explicit in types
3. Can generalise functions to any effect

# 8. Monads III
_02/03/23_


## Recap
If you want to be a Monad, you have to be an Applicative functor. 
(>>=) bind - gives you a generic way of sequencing things

## The State Monad
[Add Code]
- State - a value which changes overtime. Key part insert a stte and modify it
- Helper function helps streamline the code and changes `S` into the function.

`Char -> Int` `Char -> ST Int`
[Insert Image]

## Declaring States
```haskell
instance Monad ST where
	-- return :: a -> ST a
	return x = S(\s -> (x,s))
```
Look at the type of a, get the same type out. State is involved, but is hidden

```haskell
-- (>>=) :: ST a -> (a -> ST b) -> ST b
st >>= f = S(\s -> Let(x,s') = app st s
			 in app (f x) s')
```
Approproate form of sequencing for the state monard

## Example: relabelling trees
```haskell
data Tree = Leaf a | Node (Tree a) (Tree a)

t :: Tree Char
t = Node (Node ( Leaf 'a') (Leave b')) left 'c')

Tree a -> Int -> (Tree Int, Int)

```

### Slow way (with state)
```haskell
rlabel :: Tree a -> Int -> (Tree Int, Int)
rlabel (Leaf x) n = (Leaf n, n+1)
rlabel (Node L r) n =	(Node l' r', n'')
				where
					(l',n') = rlabel l n
					(r', n'') = rlabel r n'
```

### Better way (with monads)
```haskell
fresh :: ST Int
fresh = S (\n -> (n, n+1))

mlabel :: Tree a -> ST(Tree Int)
mlabel (Leaf x) = do n <- fresh
			   return (Leaf n)
mlabel (Node L r) = do L' <- mlabel L
			     r' <- mlabel r
			     return (Node L' r')
```

### Top Level Function
```haskell
label :: Tree a -> Tree Int
label t = fst(app(mlabel t) 0)
```

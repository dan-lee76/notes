# 2. Sudoku (3)
_09/02/23_

`choices` - takes your easy grid, replaces each blank cell with 1-9 (all possible choices)
`collapse` - takes all the possible values
`filter` - no duplicates in any row, column, box etc
`prune` - removes any choices which occur in single entries
`fix prune` - 

## Blocked Matrices
Choice matrix being void and safe

### Void
If at least one cell has no choices
```haskell
void :: Matrix Choices -> Bool
void m = any (any null) m -- any - will take predicate and check to see if it holds true for combination. In this case if true for any null 
```

`any :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> Bool`

### Safe
If all the rows, columns, boxes are consistent
```haskell
safe :: Matrix Choices -> Bool
safe m = all consistent (rows m) && all consistent (cols m) && all consisntent (boxs m)

consistent :: Row Choices -> Bool
```


```haskell
blocked :: Matrix Choices -> Bool
blocked m = void m || not (safe m) -- empty cells || duplicated single cells
```

## Solve4 & Search
```haskell
solve4 = search . prune . choices 

search :: Matrix Choices -> [Grid]
search m | blocked m = []
		| all (all single) m = collapse m
		| otherwise = [g | m' <- expand m, g <- search (prune m')] -- Expand will expand only the first cell which has more than one option. Prune will remove any 'silly choice' then do it again etc

single :: [a] -> Bool
single [_] = True
single _ = False
```

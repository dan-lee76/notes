# 4. Programming with Effects
_16/02/23_

Grahams question about life and programming:
> Shall we be pure or impure?

pure = programs are mathematical functions
impure = programs can have side effects

can we combine the two approaches (monads)
Monads - Extracting a common pattern

## Abstracting programming patterns
```haskell
inc :: [Int] -> [Int]
inc [] = []
inc (n:ns) = n+1 : inc ns

sqr :: [Int] -> [Int]
sqr [] = []
sqr (n:ns) = n^s : sqr ns
```
Have similar functions, can use `map` to recursively execute same operation on all items in the list

```haskell
map :: (a->b) -> [a] -> [b]
map f [] = []
map f (x:xs) = fx : map f xs
```

Can define `inc` and `sqr` in shorter way
`inc = map(+1)` and `sqr = map(n^2)`

## Generalising Further
```haskell
class Functor f where
		fmap :: (a->b) -> fa -> fb -- f is a member of the functor class if it follows the fmap rule successfully 
```

### List Functor
```haskell
instance Functor [] where
	-- fmap :: (a->b) -> [a] -> [b]
	fmap = map
```

`[]` - parameterised type of list. It does not mean empty list

### Maybe Functor
```haskell
data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a

instance Functor Maybe where
	-- fmap :: (a->b) -> Maybe a -> Maybe b
	fmap g Nothing = Nothing
	fmap g (Just x) = Just (g x)
```

## The tree functor
```haskell
data Tree a = Leaf a
			| Node (Tree a) (Tree a)

```

```haskell
instance Functor Tree where
	-- fmap :: (a->b) -> Tree a -> Tree b
	fmap g (Leaf x) = Leaf(g x)
	fmap g (Node L r) = Node (fmap g l) (fmap g r)

	g :: a->b
	x :: a
	L,r :: Tree a
```

## Why use functors?
1. Can use same name, for functions that are essentially the same

```haskell
inc :: Functor f => f Int -> f Int
inc = fmap(+1)

```

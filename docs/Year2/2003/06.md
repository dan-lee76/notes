## Refresh - Functor
```haskell
-- f is a type like lists, tree
class Functor f where
	fmap :: (a->b) -> f a -> f b -- f is a data structure
```

If already have a functor, can be an Applicative (using `=>`). Have to follow a set of conditions using `where`. 

Applicative functors - captures a basic form or a basic pattern with affect.

Applicative style is pure functions applied to effect for arguments
## Example: simple evaluator

```haskell
data Expr = Val Int | Div Expr Expr

eval :: Expr -> Int
eval (Val n) = n
eval (Div x y) = eval x `div` eval y -- could crash if x/y is 0
```

### Safediv
This is a safe version of div
```haskell
safediv :: Int -> Int -> Maybe Int
safediv _ 0 = Nothing
safediv n m = Just (n `div` m)
```

Now rewrite Expr so it can use safediv

```haskell
safediv :: Int -> Maybe Int
eval (Val n) = Just n
eval (Div x y) = case eval x of 
				Nothing -> Nothing
				Just n -> case eval y of 
					Nothing -> Nothing
					Just m -> safediv n m 
```
This function will never crash, however it is a bit complicated. But can simplify this further

```haskell
eval :: Expr -> Maybe Int
eval (Val n) = pure n
eval (Div x y) = pure safediv (*) eval x (*) eval y -- Best, however this cause a type error
```
Safediv is not a pure function as it returns a maybe type

### Template box
This is a case analyses on something (`[BOX]`)

```haskell
case [BOX] of
	Nothing -> Nothing
	Just x -> [BOX] x
```
Can turn this template into ->

```haskell
mx >>= f = case mx of 
				Nothing -> Nothing
				Just x -> f x
(>>=) :: Maybe a -> (a -> )

eval :: Expr -> Maybe Int
eval (Val n) = Just n
eval (Div x y) = eval x >>= (\n ->
				 eval y >>= (\m ->
				 safediv n m)
```

`>>=` is an into operator


## do notation
As this occurs frequently, can use the do notation.
Its like a syntax sugar. 

```haskell
eval :: Expr -> Maybe Int
eval (Val n) = Just n
eval (Div x y) = do n <- eval x
					m <- eval y
					safediv n m
```

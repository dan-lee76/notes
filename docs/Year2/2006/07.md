# 7.  Static members, this, references, const
_23/02/23_

## this & static methods 
### this
- An object is a collection of data (its state)
- For functions to actually do something to an object, they need to know which object to affect. 
- (Non-static) member functions have an implicit extra parameter saying which object to act on. 
	- Parameter *type* is a pointer to object
	- And the parameter *name* is `this`

### Static methods
- `static` members are shared between all objects of that class
- NOT associated with a specific object
- Static member functions **do not** have a `this` pointer

## References
- References give a new name to an existing item
- Look like normal variables 
- Act like pointers. 
- References are labelled with an `&`

### Passing Parameters
- When a function is called, the values of the parameters are copied into the stack frame for the new function
- Functions get a copy of the variable

### References vs pointers
- Pointers can be made to point to something else
- References always bind to a single object at creation, cannot be bounded to a new object
- References always have to refer to something, must give them a thing to refer to on initialisation. No such thing as `NULL` reference
- Pointers need `*` or `->` to deference them, to access the thing pointed to
- Java object references act like C/C++ pointers, NOT C++ references

### Uses
- Need to keep same syntax. 
- Useful as return values, to chain functions together. 
- References are necessary for operator overloading

## const
- `const` cannot be changed
- The thing pointer at through a pointer to const cannot be changed using the pointer. (`const` before `*`)
- Can also prevent the pointer itself from being changed (`const` after `*`)

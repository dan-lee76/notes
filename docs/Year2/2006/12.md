# 12. Template Functions & classes
_14/03/23_

Do not use a macro where the evaluation of the parameters may have a side-effect.
`max(a++,b++)` -> Evaluating these parameters alters a value 

## Template Functions
- Can use function overloading to have multiple versions of the same function
- Specify how to create functions of a certain format, if they are ever needed, e.g.:
```cpp
template <typename T>
T mymax(T a, T b){
return a > b ? a : b;
}
```
- Type placeholders are used, and are replaced implicitly.

### What they actually do
- The compiler will actually generate the functions which are needed, according to the parameters
- If there are any problems, it will not compile
- this is NOT something done at runtime

### How to create template functions
- Easy way to create these functions:
	- First manually generate a function for specific types
	- Next replace all copies of the types by an identifier
	- Then add the keyword `template` at the beginning and put the type(s) in the `<>` with keyword `typename` (or `class`)

## Template classes
- Can make template forms of entire classes as well as individual functions
- Much easier if the methods are defined inline within the class declaration

### Alter external member function definitions
- Add prior to each member function definition `template <typename T>`
- Add the `<T>` to the end of the class name in any external member function implementation/definition
- Find each occurrence of the templated type and replace it by the templated type name

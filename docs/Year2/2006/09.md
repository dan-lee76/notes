# 9. Function pointers & Virtual/non-virtual functions
_02/03/23_

## Function Pointers
- Stored in memory
	- Can ask for the address of them
	- Can store these in function pointers
- Used a lot in low-level programming
- Function pointers can be passed into functions
- Used for 'callback functions'
	- Allows something to call you back
	- 'Call this function when an event happens'
	- Event driven programming is VERY common

## v-tables
### Normal/default (non-`virtual`) functions
- Type of pointer determines function to call
- Use the type of the object the compiler thinks it is:
	- Type of pointer to the object
	- Type of the member function making the call
	- Easier for the compiler, type is known at compile-time
### Virtual Function
- Finds out the actual function to call based upon the object type AT RUNTIME - much more difficult - slower
- Works in the same way as Java functions

## Special Cases
- `virtual`-ness is inherited
- If a function is `virtual` in the base class then the function is `virtual` in the derived class(es)
- Even when the keyword `virtual` is not used in the *derived* class

### Should a function be `virtual`?
- If member function is called from a base class function or through a base class pointer AND the behaviour should depend on class type of the object then the member function has to be `virtual`
- Utility functions will often not be `virtual`

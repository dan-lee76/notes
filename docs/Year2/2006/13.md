# 13. Exceptions and RAII
_16/03/23_
## Exceptions
- Are `thrown` to report exceptional circumstances
- Can `throw` any type of object, fundamental type or pointer as exception in C++
- You add handler code to `catch` the exception
- The stack frame is unwound, one function at a time until a `catch` which matches the type thrown is found

### `catch` caluse
- A `catch` clause will match an exception of the specified type
- `catch` clauses are checked in the order in which they are encountered
- Pointers and objects are different
- Exceptions are thrown by value

## RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialisation)
- On initialisation, get the resource
- On destruction, release the resource

# 6. Classes, Constructors & inline functions
_21/02/23_

## new & delete
- Same kind of problems occur with `new` and `delete` with `malloc()` and `free()`

## Classes and structs
- In C++ you can add functions to `structs`, use inheritance etc
- Do not treat them like C items
- Implementing some of these features may require that some hidden data is created
- Only thing difference is encapsulation, `struct` is public, `class` is private
- Good C++ practises
	- Data only and no member function: use a struct. You get the guarantees about size and positions of member data that you get in a C `struct`
	- If you add member functions then use a `class`
- Data and methods in class are either `private` or `public`
- Interface methods can be:
	- **Mutators** - Change the 'state' of the object
	- **Accessors** - Only query values, no changes

## Constructors and Destructors
- Constructor - Called when an object is created
	- Created on the stack, when new is used
- Destructor - Called when an object is destroyed
	- When objects on stack are destroyed. When delete is used to destroy an object
- `malloc` and `free` do not create objects

### Default Constructor
- Constructor which can be called with no parameters or has default values for all parameters
- Used whenever no parameters are specified

Initialisation lists are used a LOT in C++

## Inline functions & Member functions and data
- Act exactly line normal function but no function call is made
- Useful for small fast one time functions

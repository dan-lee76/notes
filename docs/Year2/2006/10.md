# 10. Default class members, conversion constructors, conversion operators
_07/03/23_


## Default Member Functions
1. Default constructor (no parameters needed)
	- Constructor which takes no parameters.
	- The generated default constructor is empty
	- Why you can still create objects even when classes appear to have no constructors
	- Use `ClassName() = default;` to stop it
2. Copy constructor (cone one object to another)
	- Used to initialise one object from another of the same type.
	- Returning object by value from a function
	- A copy constructor is created by default
	- Default behaviour copies each member in turn.
3. An assignment operator (= operator)
	-  Used when value of one object is assigned to another.
	- Create your own using operator overloading
	- Takes a reference to the one we are getting values from
1. A destructor
	- Created if you do not create one
	- Gets called as members get destroyed
	- Basic data types just get destroyed
	- Pointers just get destroyed

### General Rules
- If need a copy constructor, or an assignment operator, then probably need to create the other, plus a destructor as well

## Conversion Constructors
- Conversion constructor is a constructor with one parameter
- Converts from one type of object to another
- Very similar to the copy constructor

### Forcing explicit construction
- Providing a one-parameter constructor provides a conversion constructor
- Allows compiler to use it to convert to the type whenever it wants/needs to do so
- Use the keyword `explicit`
## Conversion Operators
- Convert from a class into something else
- Uses operator overloading syntax
- Instead of an operator symbol, the new type name and `()` are used

## Friends
- Members can be private, protected or public
- **Usually** only class members can access private data
- Class can grant access to their `private` member data and functions to their `friends`
- The class still maintains control over which classes and functions have access
- The `friends` of a class are treated as class members for access purposes - although they are not members
- Declare your friends within your class body and use the keyword `friend`

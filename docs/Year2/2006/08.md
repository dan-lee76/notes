# 8. Inheritance and Virtual Functions 
_28/02/23_

## Inheritance
- Models the 'is-a' relationship. The sub-class object is-a type of base class object
- Be sure that inheritance really is what you want before use it
- Define a new class in terms of a current class
- Uses the `:` notation. Equivalent of Javas extends

```cpp
class MyClass : public MySuperClass
{

}
```
- Can have different access rights; `public` -> `protected` -> `private`

## Virtual Functions
### Cost of flexibility
- Adding a virtual function to a class may make the objects of that class bigger
- Looking up which function to call at runtime is slower when functions are virtual
	- Why the default is to not have virtual functions
- Even if a function is virtual, you can still call the base class version from the sub-class version. 

- Can use the scoping operator to call global functions or access global variables `::` with nothing before it
- Also used to denote a function is a class member in a definition
- Left of scoping operator is
	- blank - to access a global variable/function
	- class name - to access member of that class
	- namespace name - to use that namespace

## Inheritance and constructors
- Construction occurs in the order; base class first, then derived class
- Destruction occurs in the order; derived class first, then base class
- Derived classes part of the object can always assume that base class part exists
- They will NOT exist/be initialised when the base class constructor/destructor is called
- **Do not call virtual functions from the constructor or destructor**

### Virtual Destructors
- If destructor is NOT `virtual` then it will NOT be called if the object is destroyed through a base class pointer, reference or function 
- But if you make destructor `virtual` then the objects of that class will have a (hidden) vtable pointer

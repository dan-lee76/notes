# 11. Casting and Operator overloading
_09/03/23_
## Casting
- `const_cast<newtype>(?)` - Get rid of `const`ness or `volatile`ness
- `dynamic_cast<newtype>(?)` - Safely cast a pointer or reference from base-class to sub-class. Checks that it really IS a sub-class object
- `static_cast<newtype>(?)` - Cast between types, converting the type
- `reinterpret_cast<newtype>(?)` - Interpret the bits in one type as another, mainly needed for low-level code, effects are often platform-dependent

This syntax makes the presence/purpose of casts more obvious

`static_cast<type>(var)`
- Commonly used cast
- Attempts to convert correctly between two types
- Usually use this when not removing `const`-ness and there is no need to check the sub-class type at runtime

`dynamic_cast<type(var)`
- Casting from derived class to base class is easy.
- Safely convert from a base-class pointer or reference to a sub-class pointer or reference
- Checks the type at run-time rather than compile-time
- Returns NULL if the type conversion of a pointer cannot take place
- There is no such thing as a NULL reference.

`reinterpret_cast<type>(var)`
- Treat the value as if it was a different tyoe
- Interpret the bits in one type as another
- Including platform dependent conversions
- Hardly ever needed, apart from with low-level code

## Operator Overloading
- **Function overloading** - Change the meaning of a function according to the types of the parameters
- **Operator Overloading** - Change the meaning of an operator according to the types of the parameters 

### Restrictions
- Cannot change an operators precedence
- Cannot create new operators
- Cannot provide default parameter values
- Cannot change number of parameters (operands)
- Cannot override some operators
- Must overload +, += etc separately

## Post vs Pre-increment assignment vs comparision

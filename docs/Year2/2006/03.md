# 3. Stack, local variables and static locals
_09/02/23_

## Stack
- Stack is LIFO
- Function calls (Stack frames) are store on a stack in memory
- Most stacks go down in memory address
- Values are stored together in the stack frame

## Lifetime of a local variables
- Local variables exist for the duration of the stack frame they are in
- They get destroyed; if you use `malloc()` you need to call `free()`

### ⚠️DANGER⚠️
- Your local variables only exist for as long as the block in which they are defined. 
- Do not access them after that
- Do not assume that they keep their value after the function ends

## Global and static local variables
### Global Variables
- Variables are declared outside of all functions and last for the duration of the program
- All functions in the file can access goals
- Can be hidden from other files
### Local Variables
- Can be `static`
	- Means not moving/unchanging
	- NOT the same as static member variables
	- NOT the same as `const`
- Static local variables remember their value between function calls

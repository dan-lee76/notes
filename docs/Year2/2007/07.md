## Mutual Exclusions
- Software based: Peterson's solution
- Hardware based: disabling interrupts, test_and_set(), swap_and_compare()
- OS based: Mutexes, Semaphones
- Monitors: Software construct within the programming langues

## Peterson's Solution
### Software solution
- Peterson solution is a software based solution which worked well on older machines.
- Two shared variables are used:
	- `turn`: indicates which process is next to enter its critical section
	- `boolean flag[2]`: indicates that a process is ready to enter its critical section.
- Can be generalised to multiple processes

Peterson's solution for process `i`
```c
do{
	flag[i] = true; // i wants to enter critical section
	turn = j; // allow j to access first
	while (flag[j] && turn == j);
	// CRITICAL SECTION, e.g. counter++
	flag[i] = false;
	//reminder section
} while (...);
```

Peterson's solution for process `j`
```c
do{
	flag[j] = true; // j wants to enter critical section
	turn = i; //allow i to access first
	while (flag[i] && turn == i);
	// CRITICAL SECTION, e.g. counter++
	flag[j] = false;
	// reminder section
} while (...);
```

Mutexes is a spin block which will apply a wait time
### Mutual exclusion requirement
- Peterson's solution for two processes satisfies all "critical section requirements" (mutual exclusion, progress, fairness)
- Only want one process on the thread accessing the critical section at once
- Mutual exclusion requirement: the variable turn can have at most one value at a time
	- Both `flag[i]` and `flag[j]` are `true` when they want to enter their critical section
	- Turn is a **singular variable** that can store **only one value**
	- Hence, either `while(flag[i] && turn == i)` or `while(flag[j] && turn == j)` is true and at most one process can enter its critical section (mutual exclusion) 
### Progress requirement 
- Progress: any process must be able to enter its critical section at some point in time
	- Process/threads in the "remaining code" do not influence access to critical sections
	- If process `j` does not want to enter section:
```c
flag[j] == false
while(flag[j] && turn == j) //will terminate for process i 
//i Enters critical section
```

### Fairness/bounded waiting 
Fairly distributed waiting times/processes cannot be made to wait indefinitely 
## Disable interrupts
- Disable interrupts whilst executing a critical section and prevent interruption.
- Disabling interrupts *may* be appropriate on a single CPU machine.
- This is insufficient on modern multi-core/multi processor machines

## Atomic Instructions
- Implement `test_and_set()` and `swap_and_compare()` instructions as a set of atomic (= uninterruptible) instructions
	- Reading and setting the variables is done as one "complete" set of instructions
	- If they are called simultaneously, they will be executed sequentially 

## Mutual Exclusion
- `test_and_set()` and `swap_and_compare()` are hardware instructions and (usually) not directly accessible to the user. OS hides the bare metal from the user
- Other disadvantages include:
	- **Busy waiting** is used
	- **Deadlock** is possible
- The OS uses the hardware instructions to implement higher level mechanisms/instructions for mutual exclusion i.e mutexes and semaphores

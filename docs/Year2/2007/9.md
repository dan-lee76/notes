Temporary variables: Copies the value of items inside the critical section. Decrements the delay_consumer semaphore to make it consistent

A different variant of the problem has *n* consumers, *m* producers, and a fixed buffer size *N*. The solution is based on 3 semaphores:
	- `sync`: used to enforce mutual exclusion for the buffer
	- `empty`: keeps track of the number of empty buffers, initialised to *N*
	- *full*: keeps track of the number of full buffers, initialised to 0
- `empty` and `full` are counting semaphores and represent resources


## The Dining Philosophers Problem
The Problem:
- 5 Philosophers are sitting on a round table
- Each one has a plate of spaghetti
- The spaghetti is too slippery, and each philosopher needs 2 forks to be able to each
- When hungry (in between thinking), the philosopher tried to acquire the fork on his left and right.
Forks are represented by semaphores (initialised to 1)
- 1 if the fork is available: philosopher can continue
- 0 if the fork is not available: the philosopher goes to sleep if trying to acquire it 
### Solution 1 - *Deadlock*
First approach: Every philosopher picks up one fork and waits for the second one to become available(without putting the first one down)

This causes a deadlock. This can be prevented by:
- Putting the forks down and waiting a random time (ethernet networks)
- Putting one additional fork on the table
- One global mutex/lock set by the philosopher when they want to eat. *Solution does not result in maximum parallelism (only one eats at a time)*

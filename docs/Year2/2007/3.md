# 3. Processes (2)
_10/10/22_
## Process Scheduling
The OS manages and schedules processes
- New -> ready: when to admit processes to the system
- Ready -> running: decide which process to run next
- Running -> ready: when to interrupt process
The scheduler decided which process to run next. There's no one size fits all.
The type of operating system determines which algorithms are appropriate

### Time Horizon
**Long term**: admits new processes and controls the degree of multi programming. Good mix of CPU and IO bound processes. Usually absent in popular modern 
**Medium term**: controls swapping. Looks to see how busy the system currently is. 
**Short term**: which process to run next. Manages the ready queue, runs frequently (must be fast). Called following clock interrupts or blocking system calls.

### Classification by approach
- **Non-preemptive**: Processes are interrupted voluntarily
- **Preemptive**: Processes are interrupted forcefully or voluntarily. Requires context switches which generate. Prevents processes from monopolising the CPU. Most popular OS are preemptive. 

## Performance assessment
- User Oriented Criteria
	- **Response time**: time between creating the job and its first execution
	- **Turnaround time**: time between creating the job and finishing it
	- **Predictability**: variance in processing times
- System oriented criteria:
	- Throughput: number of jobs processed per hour
	- Fairness: Equally distributed processing.

## Scheduling Algorithms
1. First Come First Served/First in First out
	- Concept: Non-preemptive algorithm that operates as a strict queuing mechanism.
	- Advantages: Positional fairness an easy to implement
	- Disadvantages: Favours long processes over short ones. Could compromise resource utilisation.
2. Shortest Job First
	- Concept: A non-preemptive algorithm that starts processes in order of ascending processing time
	- Advantages: Always result in the optimal turnaround time
	- Disadvantages: Starvation might occur. Fairness and predictability are compromised. Processing times have to be known beforehand
3. Round Robin
	- Concept: A preemptive version of FCFS. Processes run in the order they were added but they only get a max amount of time at once. Forces context switches at periodic intervals
	- Advantages: Improved response time. Effective for general purpose interactive/time sharing systems
	- Disadvantages: Increased context switching and overhead. Favours CPU bound processes over IO. Can reduce to FCFS.
	- Length of time slice must be considered. Good low response time is achieved with a small time slice. High throughput is achieved with a large time slice. If time slice is only used partially, next process starts immediately 
4. Priority Queue
	- Concept: A preemptive algorithm that schedules processes by priority. Round robin is used within the same priority levels. Saved by the process control block
	- Advantages: Can priorities IO bound jobs
	- Disadvantages: Low priority may suffer from starvation

### Multi-level feedback queues
Different algorithms can be used for the individual queues.
Feedback queues allow priorities to change dynamically, jobs can move between queues. Move priorities to increase fairness

# 13. Memory Management 2

## Relocation and Protection
### Principles
- Relocation: when a program is run, it does not know in advance which partition/addresses it will occupy
	- The program cannot simply generate static addresses that are absolute
	- Addresses should be relative to where the process has been loaded
	- Relocation must be solved in an operating system that allows process to run a changing memory locations
- Protection: once you can have two programs in memory at the same time, protection must be enforced

### Address Types
- A logical address is a memory address seen by the process
	- It is independent of the current physical memory assignment
	- Its relative to the start of the program
- Physical address refers to an actual location in main memory
- The logical address space must be mapped onto the machines physical address space

### Approaches
1. Static 'relocation' at compile time: a process has to be located at the same location every single time
2. Dynamic relocation at load time
	- Offset is added to every logical address to account for its physical location in memory
	- Slows down the loading of a process, does not account for swapping
3. Dynamic relocation at runtime

### Base and Limit Registers
- Two special purpose registers are maintained in the CPU (the MMU), containing a base address and limit
	- The base register stores the start address of the partition
	- The limit register holds the size of the partition
- At runtime:
	- The base register is added to the logical(relative) address to generate the physical address
	- The resulting address is compared against the limit register
- This approach requires hardware support  (was not always present in the early days!)

## Dynamic Partitioning
- Fixed partitioning results in internal fragmentation (inside the blocks)
	- An exact match between the requirements of the process and the available partitions may not exist
	- The partition may not be used entirely
- Dynamic partitioning
	- A variable number of partitions of which the size and starting address can change over time
	- A process is allocated the exact amount of contiguous memory it requires, thereby preventing internal fragmentation

### Swapping
- Swapping holds some of the process on the drive and shuttles processes between the drive and main memory as necessary
- Reasons for swapping:
	- Some processes only run occasionally
	- Have more processes than partitions
	- A process's memory requirements have changed
	- The total amount of memory that is required for the process exceeds the available memory 
### Difficulties
- The exact memory may not be known in advance (heat and stack grow dynamically)
- External fragmentation:
	- Swapping a process out of memory will create 'a hole'
	- A new process may not use the entire 'hole', leaving a small unused block
	- A new process may be too large for a given a 'hole'
- The overhead of memory compaction to recover holes can be prohibitive and requires dynamic relocation 

### Allocation Structures
#### Bitmaps
- Simplest data structure that can be used in a form of bitmap
- Memory is split into blocks.(e.g 4kb size)
- To find a hole(128K) then a group of 32 adjacent bits set to 0 must be found, typically a long operation.
- Trade-off exists between the size of the bitmap and the size of blocks exists
	- The size of bitmaps can become prohibitive for small blocks and may make searching the bitmap slower
	- Larger blocks may increase internal fragmentation
- Bitmaps are rarely used for this reason

#### Linked List
- A more sophisticated data structure is required to deal with a variable number of free and used paritions
- 

Interal fragmentation - Inside the blocks
External fragmentaiton - outside the block

# 19.  User & Implementation view of file systems
_25/11/22_

## File Systems
- A user view that defines a file system in terms of the abstraction that the operating system provides

## User View
- **File abstraction** which hides away implementation details to the user
- File **naming policies**, user file attributes (size, protection, owner, dates)
	- Also system attributes for tiles
- **Directory structures** and organisation
- **System calls** to interact with the file system

The user view define how the file system looks like to regular users and relates to abstractions

### Files
- Many OSs support several types of file
- Both binbows and Unix have regular files and directories
	- **Regular files** contains user data in ASCII or binary format
	- **Directories** group files together
- Unix also has character and block special files
	- **Character special files** are used to model serial I/O devices
	- **Block special files** are used to model.

### System Calls
- File control blocks (FCBs) are kernel data structures (protected and only accessible in kernel mode)
- Allowing user applications to access them directly could compromise their integrity
- System calls enable a user application to ask the operating system to carry out an action on its behalf (kernel mode)
- Two different categories of system calls:
	- **File manipulation**: open(), close(), read(), write()
	- **Directory manipulation**: create(), delete(), rename()..

### File System Structures
- **Single level** - all files in the same directory
- **Two or multiple level directories** - tree structures
	- Absolute path name - from root of the file system
	- Relative path name - current working directory is used as the starting point
- **Directed acrylic graph (DAG)** - Allows files to be shared but cycles are forbidden
- **Generic graph structure** in which links and cycles can exist

The use of DAGs are generic graph structures results in significant complications in the implementations

- When searching file system; cycles can result in infinite loops, sub-trees can be traversed multiple times
- Files have multiple absolute file names
- Deleting files becomes a lot more complicated
- A garbage collection scheme may be required to remove files that are no longer accessible from the system tree

## User/Implementation View
### Directories
- Directories contain a list of human readable file names that are mapped onto unique identifiers and disk locations (mapping of the logical file onto the physical location)
- Retrieving a file comes down to searching a directory file as fast as possible:
	- A simple random order of directory entries might be insufficient
	- Indexes or hash tables can be used
- They can store all file related attributes (Windows) or they can contain a pointer to the data structure that contains the details of the file (Unix)

Directories are special files that group files together and of which the structure is defined by the file system

## Implementation View
- Irrespectively of the type of file system, a number of additional considerations have to be accessed, including:
	- Disk partitions, partition tables, boot sectors
	- Free space management
	- System wide and per process file tables
- Low level formatting writes sectors to the disk, high level formatting imposes a file system on top of this

### Hard Disk Structures
Master boot record is located at start of the entire drive
- Used to boot the computer (BIOS reads and executes MBR)
- Contains partition table as its end with active partition
- One partition is listed as active containing a boot block to load the operating system

### Partition Layouts
- The layout of a partition differs depending on the file system
- A UNIX partition contains:
	- Thee partition boot block:
		- Contains a code to boot the operating system
		- Every partition has boot block
	- **Super block** contains the partitions details (size, number of blocks etc)
	- **Free space management** contains bitmap or linked list that indicates the free block
	- **I-nodes** - an array of data structures, one per file, telling all about the files
	- **Root directory** - the top of the file-system tree
	- **Data** files and directories

### Disk Space Management
- Two methods are commonly used to keep track of free disk space: bitmaps and linked lists
- Not that these approaches are very similar to the ones to keep track of free memory
- Bitmaps represent each block by a single bit in a map
	- The size of the bitmap grows with the size of the disk but is constant for a given disk
	- Bitmaps take comparably less space than linked lists
- Linked list of disk blocks (Known as grouping)
	- Use free blocks to hold the number of the free blocks
	- Blocks are linked together i.e. multiple blocks list the free blocks
	- The size of the list grows with the size of the disk and shrinks with the size of the blocks
- Linked lists can be modified by keeping track of the number of consecutive free blocks for each entry

#### Summary
Bitmaps
- Require extra space. 
- Keeping it in main memory is possible only for small disks
Linked lists
- No waste of disk space
- Only need to keep in memory one block of pointers

### File Tables
Number of key data structures stored in memory:
- All in-memory mount table
- An in-memory directory cache of recently accessed directory information 
- A system-wide open file table, containing a copy of the FCB for every currently open file in the system, including location on disk, file size, and open count
- A per-process open file table, containing a pointer to the system open file table

## Computer Design
### Registers
- **Data Registers** - Any sort of data for special functions. 
- **Program Counter-** Holds the next instruction.
- **Program status word**  - admin, stores the mode bit. Which mode the CPU is in, kernel mode or user mode.
- **User Mode** - Direct access to a subset of instructions the CPU can carry out
- **Kernel mode** - Access to the full set of instructions. Including privileged memory locations. 
- Normally compiler decides which mode to use

### Memory Management Unit
*Location of an address*
Doesn't know where in memory an executable will run. Variables require memory, they need to have a memory space
- **Logic Address Space** -  Used by the processor and the compiler (starts at 0). What you use when you write code. Every process has one [0,MAX^64] 
- **Physical Address Space** - Seen by the hardware/OS [0,MAX] (Determined by the amount of physical memory)
Also responsible for address translation `physical = locgical + x`

### Moors Law
> **Moore's law** - The number of transistors on an integrated circuit doubles roughly every two years. 

Closely linked but necessarily related to performance. 
Still continuing but the power wall slows performance improvements of single core
Can extract parallelism automatically, can implement it at the lowest level

### Multi-core, hyper-threaded processors
Evolution in hardware has implications on OS design
The process scheduling needs to account for load balancing and CPU affinity. Need to decide **when** and **where** it is going to run

### Micro Kernels
All non-essential functionality is extracted from the kernel. These are easier to extend, more portable and more reliable.
Frequent system calls cause mode switches/overhead

**Monolithic Systems** - All procedures into one single executable running in kernel mode. However, they are difficult to maintain. Current versions of Windows, and Linux are implemented as this.

## Introduction to processes
Running instance of a program. This has 'control structures' - they store all the necessary information related to the management of the process

### Context Switching
Process control box contains:
- **Process identification** (PID, UID, Parent PID)
- **Process control information** (process state, scheduling information)
- **Process state information** (user registers, program counter, stack pointer, program status word, memory management information, files)
The **process control block** is **necessary** for **context switching** in **multi-programmed systems**
Process control blocks are kernel data structures, which are stored in the **process table** and are accessible in the **kernel mode** only (system calls), otherwise this would compromise their integrity.

#### Multi-Programming
Achieved by alternating processes and context switching
- Single processor systems results in concurrent execution
- True parallelism requires multiple processors

Slow time slices - good response times, low utilisation
Long time slices - poor response times, better utilisation

#### Process
Memory image contains: the program (shared) code, data segment (stack/heap)
Every process has own logical address space
Some OS address space layout are randomised 

### Process implementation
Information about the status of "resources" is maintained in tables. These are in kernel space and cross referenced
- **Process tables** - process control blocks
- **Memory tables** - memory allocation, protection, virtual memory 
- **I/O tables** - Availability, status, transfer information
- **File tables** - Location, status

### States and Transitions
![](../_resources/20221007111037.png)
- **New** process has just been created and is waiting to be admitted
- **Ready** process is waiting for the CPU to become available
- **Running** process 'owns' the CPU
- **Blocked** process cannot continue (waiting for IO)
- **Terminated** process is no longer executable
- **Suspended** process is swapped out

### System Calls
- True system calls are "wrapped" in the OS libraries following a well defined interface
- These are necessary to notify the OS that the process has terminated
- `fork()` - creates an exact copy of the current process

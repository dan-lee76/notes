# 1. OO and Java Programming Refresher (1)
_07/10/22_

## Basic OO Concepts
- Abstraction: Simple things like objects represent more complex underlying code and data
- Encapsulation: The ability to protect some components of the object from external access
- Inheritance: The ability for a class to extend or override functionality of another class
- Polymorphism: The provision of a single interface to entities of different types
	- Compile time polymorphism: Method overloading
	- Run time polymorphism: Method overriding

## Encapsulation
- Hiding the implementation details of a class (all fields and helper methods private)
- Helps with program maintenance: a change in one class does not affect other classes
- A client of a class interacts with the class only through well-documented public constructors and methods; this facilitates team development

## "this"
- Refers to the implicit parameter inside the class

## Constructors
- Constructors of a class can call each other using the keyword "this" (this can avoid code duplicating)
- Constructors are invoked using the operator new.
- Parameters passed to "new" must match the number, types and order of parameters expected by one of the constructors

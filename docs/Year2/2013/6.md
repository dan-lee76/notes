# 6. Object Oriented Design in Depth
_24/10/22_

## Object
> Set of closely related data and methods that operate on the data (or services)

An object:
- Knows what it is
- Knows its responsibilities and how to fulfil them
- Has a role to play in the system and knows how to do it
- Does not know how to do anything else

### Accessing object capabilities
- **Messages**
	- Object A sends a message to B
	- Object B does X which may involved returning results
- **Behaviour** of an object: Set of messages recognised by an object
- **Method**: A function performed by an object as a result of a valid message
- **Signature** (Similar to prototype): Method name, parameters and types, values returned
## Classes & Instances
- Often a system needs many copies of a given kind of object 
- Need to organises objects of same types
- **Class**
	- Set of objects that share same behaviour
	- Generic, specification of all such objects
	- template that defines such objects
- **Instance**
	- A member of a class (object itself)
## Typical Class Hierarchy
- Derived classes
- Inherit behaviour from parent classes
- Define additional behaviour
- May need to redefine functionality of parent

## Overview of OO Design
1. Initial exploration - Find classes, operations, collaborations
2. Detailed analysis - Build class hierarchies
3. Subsystem identification 

### 1. Initial Exploration
First efforts are exploratory, try out various approaches
1. Identify the classes in system
2. Identify responsibilities in system
3. Determine how each object collaborates with other objects to carry out its responsibilities 
Identifying objects:
- Nouns = Classes
- Verbs = Methods

### 2. Analysis
1. Examine classes and responsibilities to define if classes share behaviour
2. Streamline collaborations
### 3. Identify Subsystems
- Subsystem = a set of classes that collaborate to fulfil a set of responsibilities. 
- Heavy collaboration among a set of classes may imply need for a subsystem
- Subsystems are a yet higher level of partitioning/abstractions. Simplify complexity, hides complex collaboration, increase potential for re-usability 
## Client/Server Model and Terminology
- OO model is a client/server model
- Object collaborations are one way
	- Client object requests service
	- The server object receives request and provides service
	- The interactions is defined by a contract
### Client-Server Contract
- Client and server are roles that objects play. Can take either or both roles at different times.
- Client/server concepts keep track of the relationship between 2 objects at a specific time

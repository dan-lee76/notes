# 15. Maintainable GUI Development

## MVC Pattern Revisited
- View tells controller what happened
- Controllers inform the model what to do
- Once the job is finished the model broadcasts notifications; it is not aware of any specific view/controller
- Views catches relevant notifications and updates

Observer pattern is embedded in the MVC
- Model offers views to subscribe to its state change notifications
- Any interested views subscribe to the model to receive state change notifications
- The model notifies all views that had subscribed whenever a model state changes


## FXML (FX Markup Language)
- Supports the idea of separating *Design* and *Functionality*

Benefits of FXML
- UI designers might not be programmers
- The designers can use external software to design the look of the UI whilst the programmers can build the functionality
- Building GUIs visually rather than programmatically makes intuitive sense
- Event handling is simplified
- We can test/fix application logic without touching the GUI design

# 10. Subsystems
_31/10/22_
## Subsystem 
- Inital design - classes, responsibilities, collaborations
- Second stage - analyse hierarchies, identify contracts
- New goals: Simplify patterns of communication, identify subsystems, design good interface to subsystems and classes

### Collaboration Graphs
Represent the flow of information in system during execution.
Collaboration graph includes:
- Classes and their hierarchies
- Contracts
- Collaborations


Subsystems - Groups of classes that collaborate among themselves to support a set of contracts
From outside - The classes work closely together to provide a clearly defined unit of functionality
From inside - Classes can have some complex interrelationships of collaborations
### Superclass vs Subsystem
- Superclass groups a set of classes with identical responsibilities
- Subsystem is a group of classes with different responsibilities that can work together to fulfil a greater responsibilities 

### Contracts
Subsystems also support contracts. 
- Collaboration from a class outside the subsystem to a class inside subsystem is redefined to be a collaboration with subsystem
- The contract used for collaboration becomes a subsystem contract. This delegates contract to the class that supports it

### Subsystems from Top
Help simplify a design near the end of design
- Used early in design:
	- Identify its major subsystems
	- Treat them as classes
	- Decompose subsystems into other subsystems
- Used to start out a class:
	- Too complex or has too many responsibilities
	- Gets subdivided into more classes that combine into subsystem
### Subsystems are Conceptual
Only conceptual units
- They don't exist at execution time but their classes do
- Don't directly fulfil responsibilities 

## Identifying Subsystems
Look for strongly coupled classes
Coupling is a measure of how much they depend on each other
### Coupling
- Frequently used collaborations
- A web of many collaborations among a set of classes that are connected to reset of the graph with fewer collaborations 

## Simplifying Interactions
Should help to simplify class interactions 
- Complex interactions are hard to maintain, lead to spaghetti code, and are generally to be avoided
- Area of complexity in graph should be focus of effort
- Proposed change should simplify graph

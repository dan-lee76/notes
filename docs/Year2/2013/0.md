# 0. Introduction to Developing Maintainable Software
## Core attributes of maintainable software
- Readable Code
- Strong documentation
- Consistent variable/functions conventions
- Standard code layout (whitespace/variables)
- Testability

## Developing Maintainable Software
### Three principles for developing maintainable software
- Maintainability benefits most from adhering to simple guidelines
	- Never write methods that have more than 15 lines of code
- Maintainability is not an afterthought, but should be addressed from the very beginning of a development project
- Some violations are worse than other; the more a software system compiles with the guidelines, the more maintainable it is

What software maintenance involves: The process for managing and executing software maintenance activities is described. However, also need to consider how we can reduce the effort of maintenance.

### Main Categories of Maintenance 
- Corrective maintenance: Finding and fixing errors in the system
- Adaptive Maintenance: The system has to be adapted to changes in the environment in which it operates
- Perfective + Preventive Maintenance: Users of the system have new or changed requirements. Ways identified to increase the quality or prevent future bugs.

### Software Maintenance Process
- Understanding the client
- Understanding the existing code
- Refactoring the existing code
- Extending the existing code
- Working as a team
- Managing client expectations
- Managing the maintenance process

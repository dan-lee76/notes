# 5. Documentation and Version Control
_24/10/21_
## Documenting Code
### Professional Level Source Code Documentation
- Code comments are essentials for maintenance as they are key to having another person be able to understand what you have done
- Semi-Automatic documentation enables:
	- Standard comment formatting and structure
	- Less typing, some automation
- Examples include Doxygen and Javadoc. 
### IDEs
- Many tools are build into IDEs, it is great for helping create maintainable code including in-built testing help
- Javadoc is great for java documentation. This comes with JDK and requires you to tag your code with special comments
### Useful Javadoc Tags
`@<tag>` - Syntax. Generates easy to use HTML based output as a living document.Updated each compile time.
Useful tags:
- `@param`: explain a method parameter
- `@return`: to annotate a method return value
- `@throws`/`@exception`: for your exception handling
- `@deprecated`: bits of the code you no longer use
- `{@code}`: puts syntax in your documentation 
## Version Control
- Ability to recover old versions and examine source code history
- Works across networks (fosters collaboration)
- Similar with a networked file system + backup + additional functionality. 
- **Repository**: Stores a file system tree. Remembers every change ever written to it
- **Concurrency Management**: Simultaneous occurrence; coincidence. Ways to deal with concurrency:
	- Problem of file sharing
	- Lock-modify-unlock solution
	- Copy-modify-merge solution
- **Lock-Modify-Unlock Solution**: Serialisation. There is no protection for breaking dependencies between files. False sense of security 

### Concurrency Management
- Copy-modify-merge model: for text files
	- Users work in parallel
	- Concurrent changes are automatically merged
	- Conflicts can generally be managed
- The lock-modify-unlock model: for all types

### Working Copy
- Regular directory tree
- It does not unless specifically told:
	- Incorporate others people changes
	- Make your own changes available to others
- A typical repository = severl projects
- Each project = subdirectory

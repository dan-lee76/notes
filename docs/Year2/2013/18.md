## Introduction
Core attributes of maintainable software 
- Readable code
- Strong documentation
- Consistent variable/functions conventions
- Standard code layout
- Testability

Main principles for developing software
- Maintainability benefits most from adhearing to simple guidelines
- Maintainability is not an afterthought should be addressed from the very beginning of a development project
- Some violation are worse than others; the more a software system compiles with the guidelines for more maintainable it is

Software maintenance involves - The process for managing and executing software maintenance activities is described. Also need to consider how we can reduce the effort of maintenance

Main Categories
- **Corrective maintenance** - Finding and fixing errors in the system
- **Adaptive Maintenance** - The system has to be adapted to change in the environment in which it operates
- **Perfective + Preventive Maintenance** - Users of the system have new or changed requirements. Ways identified to increase the quality or prevent future bugs.

## Basic Concepts
- **Abstraction** - Simple things like objects represent more complex underlying code and data
	- Cannot be used to instantiate objects but references to abstract classes are legal.
	- Classes can have instance methods that implement a default behaviour. May contain non-final variables
- **Encapsulation** - Ability to protect some components of the object from external access. 
	- Making public variables private
	- Hiding the implementation details of a class
	- Helps with program maintenance (doesn't affect other classes)
- **Inheritance** - Ability for a class to extend or override functionality of another class
- **Polymorphism** - The provision of a single interface to entities of different types. 
	- Compile time - Method overloading - Same name co-exists in the same class but they must have different method signatures
	- Run time - Method overriding - Same name is declared in super and sub class
- `this` - Refers to the implicit parameter inside the class
- **Constructors** - Invoked using the `new` operator
- Passing Data - Can either pass by value or pass by reference
- **Overloaded Methods** - Methods of the same class that have the same name but different numbers/types. Compiler will treat them as completely different methods
- **Static Field** - Shared by all objects of the class. Normally stored with the class code. Not initialised in constructors.
- **Non-Static Field** - Belongs to an individual object
- **Static Methods** - Access and manipulate class statics fields. Belongs to the class, not an instance of it. Cannot access instance fields or call methods of the class.
- **Instance Methods** - Can access all fields and call all methods of their class (Static and non-static).


## Java Collections Framework
- Collection is an object that represents a group of objects. This contains data structures and algorithmic operations
- **Collection** - Something that holds a dynamic collection of objects
- **Map** - Defines mapping between keys and objects
- **Iterable** - Collections are able to return an iterator object that can scan over the contents of a collection one object at a time
- **Queue** - Represents FIFO queues and LIFO stacks
- **Deque** - Represents a double ended queue
- **Set** - A collection that cannot contain duplicate elements
- **List** - An ordered sequence of elements that allows duplicate elements
- **Typesafe collection with 'Generics'** - Classes support generics by allowing a type variable to be included in their declaration; type are declared for the reference and constructor. Cannot type a collection using a primitive type
- **TreeSet Class** - Provides an implementation of the set interface that uses a tree for storage (ascending order)
- **HashMap Class** - Hash table implementation of the map interface. The implementation provides all of the optional map operations, and permits null values and the null key

## Implementation of OOP concepts in Java
**Aggregation** - Object of class B is **part of** an object of class A but the object of class B can be shared and if the object of class A is deleted, class B is not deleted

**Composition** - An object of class A **owns** an object of class B and the object of class B cannot be shared and if the object of class A is deleted, the object of class B is also deleted

**Inheritance** - Forming new classes based on existing ones. (is-a relationship)
- *superclass* - parent class being extended
- *subclass* - child class that inherits behaviour from the parent class


**Interfaces**
- Methods are implicitly abstract, cannot have implementations but rather are implemented. Is an abstract type that is used to describe a behaviour that classes must implement. Implements an interface must implement all of the non-default methods describe in the interface. Less restrictive when it comes to inheritance

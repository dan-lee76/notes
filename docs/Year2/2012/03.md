# 3. Nondeterministic Finite Automata
_09/02/23_

## What is NFA
- NFA have transition functions that map a given state and an input symbol to zero or more successor states.
- They have more than one initial state. Machine has a choice As long as the word is valid from one initial state, then its valid in the language

A *nondeterministic finite automaton* (DFA) $A = (Q,\Sigma,δ,S,F)$
1. A finite set of states $Q$
2. A finite set of input symbols, the alphabet, $\Sigma$
3. A transition function $δ\in Q \times \Sigma \to P(Q)$
4. An initial state $S \subseteq Q$
5. A set of final (or accepting) states $F\subseteq Q$

In contract to a DFA, NFA may have many initial states, not just one, and its transition function maps a state and an input symbol to a set of possible successor states, not a single state.


## The language accepted by an NFA

- To define the *extended transition function* for NFAs we use a generalisation of the union operation $\cup$.
- All the states anded together

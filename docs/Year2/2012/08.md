How to show that a language is not regular 

## The Pumping Lemma
Given a regular language $L$, then there is a number $n\in\mathbb{N}$ such that all words $w\in L$ that are longer than $n(|w|\ge n)$ can be split into three words $w = xyz$ s.t.
1. $y \neq \epsilon$ 
2. $|xy| \le n$
3. $\forall k \in \mathbb{N} . xy^kz\in L$

*Example Languages*
L1: Binary sequences representing binary numbers (no leading 0s)
L2: Binary sequences representing prime numbers 
L3: Sequence of a,b with the same number of a's b's
L4: Sequences of a,b with the same number of a's and b's MOD 2
L5: Sequences of '(' , ')' match with brackets match
L6: Sequences of characters representing valid C programs
L7: Sequences of characters of the form code, arg where code is a valid C program, def a function f st. f("arg") terminates 
L8: Sequences over a,b,c which are either in the set {ab,ac,abc} -> finite language

(Dan Terms) - Language is a set of rules which need to be followed for it to become valid

## Definition
A language is a set of words (produces own words)
word - sequence of symbols
symbols - an element of an alphabet
alphabet - a finite set (or type) 

$\Sigma$ (sigma) 
$\Sigma_{1}={a,b,c}$

$\Sigma^*$ is the same as List $\Sigma$ in lean

$L \in \Sigma^**$ (language in set) Also saying L is a predicate

## Operations on Languages




## Other notes
Inductive Definition - All the ways elements on $\Sigma^*$ can be defined.
Kleene star/operator/closure - Unary \*-operator
Only write $\in$ when on its own

$\in$  - Denotes the empty word, a sequence of symbols of length 0
âˆ… - Denotes the empty set, a set with no elements
{$\in$} - Is a set with exactly one element 0 the empty word

Can use exponent notation to denote concatenation of a word with itself. $u^2 = uu$.
$u^0 = \in$

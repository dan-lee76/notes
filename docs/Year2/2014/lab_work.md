### Marshalling
**Does each method of encoding (UTF-8 String, Data stream, JSON, XML and Object stream) successfully read back the same value as was written?**
- They all do?

**For the first (string) encoding, how many characters are in the string? How many bytes are in the message? Why**
- 7 Characters, and 8 bytes.

**For the first (string) encoding, would you need to send any extra information apart from the bytes? Why/why not? (hint: would the receiver know that they had received the full message?)**

**What would be the limitations of just sending strings using the first method? When might another of the methods be better?**

**For the second (data output stream) encoding, what two types/values does it write How are they encoded in the byte stream?**

**What two types/values does it read? What would happen if the reading code attempted to read different types/values?**

**What limitation(s) does this impose? When might another of the methods be better?**

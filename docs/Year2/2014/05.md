## RPC and RMI Summary
- RPC paradigm is the concept that porgrammers should be able to invoke remote operations in the same way as local procedure calls
- RMI extends this concept to distributed objects 
	- A remote reference represents a remote object
- Remote invocations differ from local ones because:
	- Memory is not shared between the caller and the procedure body
	- They are much slower than local calls
	- They are subject to network and server failures

## Defining a remote interface
- What is the service? -> each service = 1 remote interface
- What distinct requests can a client make? -> each request = 1 method
- How can each request be concisely described? -> = method name
- What information does the client have that the server needs to perform the request? -> = arguments - types (and names)
- What might be anticipated to go wrong? -> =exceptions
- If it works, what information does the client need back? -> = return type

## RMI argument/return types
- Passed by value (primitive values, Serialisable objects)
	- Methods called on the *Serialisable* copy run only on the copy; changes to copy's fields are not visible elsewhere
	- => Keeping and using the copy may be more efficient
- Passed by reference/proxy (Remote objects)
	- Methods called on remote proxies run on the server object
	- => Making repeated remote method calls should be more consistent or up to date

## Implementing a Remote Object
- Each remote interface needs an implementation that will be run in the server process
- Encapsulates state, implements methods
- Class names here are *Servant* also called *Impl* or *Implementation*

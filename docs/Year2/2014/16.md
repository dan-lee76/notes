### Approach
- Assume that processes can be trusted, there are no arbitrary failures and communication is reliable
- Set aside a specialised coordinator process to coordinate the entire transaction

### Algorithm Overview
- Each participant breaks down the operation into two stages or phases
	- Tentatively performing the operation
	- Making the successful result permanent and visible (committing the result)
- These two stages or phases are managed by the coordinator process
### The two=phase commit protocol

### Notes
- So if no operation fails then all processes will reply to canCommit? with Yes
	- All of the operations will be committed
	- Effects of all operations will be observed
- So if any operation fails then the process will reply to canCommit? with No
	- All of the operations will be aborted
	- So no effect of any operation will be observed

### Failures
- But what will happen if a process crashes??
- Depends when:
	- Before any doCommit the transaction can be aborted, 
	- but afterwards it cannot
	- Need to be sure in that case that the process will be restarted and will definitely commit the operation

## Data Replication 
### (A) System model for managing replicated data
- We will assume physical replicas of objects are maintained by Replica Managers (RMs)
- A service is provided by a cooperating set of RMs
- Each client (only) makes requests via a Front End
	- May be part of the client, or may be a separate process
	- Provides the basis for client replication transparency
- Requests can be read-only or update

### Phases of request handling (general framework)
1. Request issued by FE (Either to one RM or multicast to all RMs)
2. Coordination between RMs on whether to perfrom request and in what order
	1. Typically FIFO, or may be Casual or Total order
3. Execution by RMs
4. Agreement by RMs on effect
5. Response by one or more RMs to FE

### Fault tolerant service
- Want to use this model to design a fault tolerant service which can tolerate up to f process failures
- (Intuitively) correct if each client gets the same results as they would have got from a single correct Replica Manager

### Option 1 - Passive (primary backup) replication request handling
1. Request - (with unique ID) is sent by the clients Front End to one primary Replica Manager
2. Coordination - The primary takes requests in order
3. Execution - The primary executes a stores results
4. Agreement - If request is an update, the primary sends updated state, response and ID to all backup RMs
5. Response - Primary responds to FE and hence client 

### How does it achieve fault tolerance?
- For correct operation, if the primary fails then
	- The backups must agree on one backup to be the new primary 
	- All RMs must agree on which operations had been performed at the point when new primary takes over
- If a backup fails then the result just continue
- If a failed RM recovers then it must re-synchronise

### Notes
- Surviving up to f crashes requires at least f+1 Replica Managers
- Cannot cope with Byzantine failures
- Has relatively large overheads
- Client may be able to submit read request to backup RMs

### Option 2 - Active replication
1. Request - Is sent by Front End to all Replica Managers
2. Coordination - The multicast group delivers the request to all active RMs
3. Execution - Every RM executes the request
4. Agreement - None required with reliable multicast
5. Response - Every RM sends response to FE

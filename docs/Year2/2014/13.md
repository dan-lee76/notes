## IP Multcast and broadcast
### IP Broadcast
- IP Broadcast allows a single UDP datagram to be sent to all of the hosts on a physical network
- Datagram is addressed to an IP broadcast address
	- Effectively represents ALL hosts on a network
- Address 255.255.255.255 = broadcast address for *this* network
	- Highest IP address on a subnet is the broadcast address for that subnet
- On the destination network, the IP broadcast address is mapped to a link layer broadcast address
- The physical network copies the broadcast frame to all hosts
- All physical network interfaces accept frames addressed to the broadcast MAC address
- Then the frame (IP datagram) is passed to the OS to handle

### IP Multicast
- Multicast is a Class D IPv4 address
- These addresses represent groups of machines rather than individual hosts (or networks)
	- Any host can choose to join any number of groups
	- OS then configures network cards to accept corresponding frames, and inform local routers/switches
- Specific ranges of multicast addresses are assigned to specific purposes 
	- Local network control block (224.0.0.0 to 224.0.0.224) for multicast traffic within a given local network
- IP Multicast allows a single UDP datagram to be sent efficiently to many (not all) hosts
- Datagram is addressed to an IP multicast address
- This is mapped to a link layer multicast address
- Physical network copies the frame to all relevant hosts
- The physical network interface accepts the multicast frame

### Multicast considerations
- **Failure Model** - Same as UDP, best effor
	- Any subset of hosts may receive a given message
	- Messages may be re-ordered across inter networks
- Making multicast **reliable** is complicated
- **Wide-area support** - Multicast works well on Ethernet and WiFi but is often NOT forward by routers

### Applications
- Performance/network efficiency - single physical copy can reach all machines on (local) network
- **Fault tolerance** - multiple servers can receive/handle a single multicast request
- **Service discovery** - multicast request when server IP is unknown
- Local **Peer-to-Peer** applications 

## Broadcast and Multicast Applications (including Discovery)
### DHCP
- Every host on the internet needs to know its IP address, network, gateway, DNS server
- Often discovered when the machine connects to a local network by using DHCP
- New machines broadcasts a DHCP request to the local network
- Delivered to every machine on the network
- Any DHCP server on the local network handles the request and provides the information
### Network Discovery Service
- Discovery services are directory services that typically operate over local networks where devices and processes are initially unknown to one anohter
- Various implementation approaches
	- Often use network multicast initally
	- Java JINI

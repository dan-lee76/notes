## Interaction Models
### Models and Assumptions


### Computer clocks and timing events
- Most computers have an internal clock which local processes can use to get the current time
- But two processes in a distributed system reading their clocks at the same moment can get different time values
- Each clock with drift from perfect time
- Clocks can be correct to some extend by:
	- Using a GPS receiver on each computer where available/cost-effective => ~1 microsecond accuracy
	- Sending messages to other process => accuracy depends on communication latency

### Synchronous distributed systems
- Time to execute each step of a process has known upper and lower bounds
- Each message transmitted over a channel is received within a known bounded time
- Each process has a clock whose drift rate from real time has a known bound

### Asynchronous distributed systems
Has no bounds on:
- Process execution speeds
- Message transmission delays
- Clock drift rates
E.g.
- Busy web server can take a long time to handle a request
- An email can take days to arrive
- A servers clock can differ by any amount from the real time

### Synchronous vs Asynchronous 
- Modelling interaction in a synchronous system can be useful, and simpler than the alternative
- Some problem are impossible to solve in an asynchronous system, but can be solved


## Distributed Algorithms
- **Algorithm** - Describes a sequence of steps to be taken to perform a particular operation
- **Distributed algorithm** - Describes the steps to be taken by *each process* in the distributed system, including sending/receiving messages
- Intended to achieve one or more goals/outcomes
- A correct algorithm will satisfy those goals - hopefully provably - provided its assumptions are met. If the constrains are not met, then most likely to fail
- One distributed algorithm may provide a basis on which to build another

## Logical Time
- In an asynchronous system
	- Host clocks are not synchronised
	- So cannot provide a definite ordering of events happening at different hosts
- Want to preserve the logical relationships between events
- Represented as the **happened before** relation $\to$
	- $a\to b$ means even $a$ happened before event $b$
	- If $c$ happens before $d$ in the same process then $c\to d$
	- Sending a message always happens before receiving the message

### Lamports logical clock algorithm
- Each process $p_i$ maintains a **logical clock** $L_i$ which is used to assign Lamport timestamps to each event
	- $L_i(e)$ is the timestamp of event $e$ at the process $i$
	- $L(e)$ is the timestamp of event $e$ at the process it occurred at
- LC1: $L_i$ is incremented before each event at $p_i$
- LC2(a): when $p_i$ sends a message $m$ it piggybacks the value $t=L_i$
- LC2(b): on receiving $(m,t)$ at $p_j$, do $L_j = \max(L_j,t)$ then LC1 then timestamp `recieve(m)`

## Routing in Distributed Hash Tables
In the Pastry DHT
- Each node has a GUID
- Each value/file has a GUID
- Values are stored at the node whose GUID is closest to the values
- The nodes organise themselves into an overlay network that is a ring sorted in order of GUID

### Pastry request routing
- Routing requests to add/remove/get a specified value GUID
- So a request can be routed in the overlay network simply by sending it to he neighbour in the direction with the closer GUID
	- Each node knows it neighbours whether it is current to the closest node
	- Each hop will get closer
	- So eventually it will reach the right node

# BSc Computer Science @ University of Nottingham
## Welcome
These are my notes whilst studying at university. Some of them are a bit bad, but some are good. Sections of notes will contain dan words/dan method. These are **EXCLUSIVE** terminologies I use to help me remember/understand. You may not understand them, but I do.

## Developer Notice
You can probably see this site is still in development and links could change later on so try not to save them pls. Sidebar and information presentation is very messed up, so keep that in mind whilst navigating. You can stalk this project on [GitHub](https://github.com/dan-lee76/notes) if you really want to.
## Welcome
These are my notes whilst studying at UoN. Some of them are a bit bad, but some are good. Sections of notes will contain dan words/dan method. These are **EXCLUSIVE** terminologies I use to help me remember/understand. You may not understand them, but I do.

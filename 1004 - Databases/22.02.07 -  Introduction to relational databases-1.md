> Everything in the module will be SQL databases, other databases which are not relational and will not be looking at them in this module

## Why databases
Give a set of tools for storing, searching and managing this information
> Basic concepts and skills with database systems are part of the skill set you will be **assumed** to have as a CS graduate

## Early days
Used to be file-based systems, each file had its own format and the program had to know what format. Any other program using that file would also have to know that format

## Database Management System
- A program in the middle can coordinate access
- Applications link with DBMS rather than data files

## Definitions
**Database**: Shared collection of logically related data and a description of the data designed to meet the needs of an organisation
**Database Management System**: Software system which enables the user to control the database
**Application Program**: Program which interacts with a database through the DBMS 

## The relational Model
- The foundation for most modern database systems
- **Information stored as records in relations (tables)**

### Structure
- Data is stored in relations (tables)
- Relations are made up of attributes (columns)
- Data takes the form of tuples (rows) 
	- Must not be duplicate tuples

Each column has a domain, a set from which all possible values for that column can come

- Degree of a relation - How long each tuple is or how many columns the table has
- Cardinality of a relation - How many different tuples there are, or how many rows a table has

### Schemas and Attributes
Often helpful to reference columns using names
**Attributes** are named columns in a relation
**Schema** defines the attributes for a relation . Each relation has a schema. Scheme is like a header for the column. (All headers wrapped in one big {})

### Named and Unnamed Tuples
Tuples specify values for each attribute in a relation, can be named as sets of pairs, or unnamed for convenience.
Need to be careful with the ordering of unnamed tuples
Tuple e.g. {(ID, A368), (Name. Jane Brown) ...}

Summary:
**Schema** is a set of attributes
**Tuple** assigns a value to each attribute in the schema
**Relation** is a set of tuples with the same schema

### Candidate Keys
A set of attributes in a relation is a candidate key if and only if
- Every tuple has a unique value for that set of attributes: **uniqueness**
- No proper subset of the set has the uniqueness property: **minimality**

Choosing Candidate Keys - Cant necessarily infer the candidate keys based solely on the data in your table
Must use knowledge of the real-world to help

### NULLs and Primary Keys
Primary Key - Unique identifier 
Missing information can be represented using NULLs
Not the same as 0 or blank character
**Entity integrity**: Primary Keys cannot contain NULL values

### Foreign Keys
Used to link data in two relations
Set of attributes in the first relation is a foreign key if its value matches a primary/candidate key value in a second relation
Called Referential Integrity

### Referential Integrity
When relations are updated, referential integrity might be violated
Usually occurs when a referenced tuple is updated or deleted

Number of options when this occurs:
- RESTRICT – stop the user from doing something
- CASCADE – let the changes flow on
- SET NULL – make referencing values null
- SET DEFAULT – make referencing values the default for their column

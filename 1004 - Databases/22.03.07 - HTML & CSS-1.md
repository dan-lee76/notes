# HTML
HTML - Page description language. Contains both formatting instructions(tags) and content

Static HTML - Web page is a file on a server
Dynamic HTML- Web pages consist of HTML that is generated by software (PHP). Software can communicate with databases

## Client-Server Paradigm
- A server provides specific services
- Server application waits passively for contacts from clients
- Clients initiate contacts/server responds
- Information can flow in both directions

## Other Web Technologies
CSS - fine control for the user interface
PHP - Data driven websites
JavaScript (JS) - User Interaction
DOM - allows identification of elements of web sites

## URL
URL - Uniform Resource Locator
`scheme://prefix.domain:port/path/filename`
- **scheme** - defines the type of internet service
- **Prefix** - defines a domain prefix
- **domain** - registered internet domain
- **port** - port number of the server
- **path** - where the file is on the server
- **filename** - the name of the document

## Tags
- Tags are instructions to the browser
- They have structural meaning - they (mostly) don't control the user interface. 
- The appearance of tags is controlled by CSS, the Browser and NB with HTML 5
- A tag together with its content is called an element
- Attributes appear between the name and the right bracket of the opening tag

**Attributes** - Optionally a start tag may include one or more attributes. Additional information about the element

**Empty Elements** - Elements with no content are called empty elements eg `<br>` and  `<hr>`

`<head>` - Various useful things put inside this
`<body>` - Content of the page. Structural Information

## Tables
`<table>` - Starts table
`<th>` - Table Heading/Column
`<tr>` - Table row
`<td>` - Table data

## Lists
`<ul>` - Unordered List
`<ol>` - Ordered List
`<li>` - List Item

# CSS
CSS = Cascading Style Sheets
Mechanism to control and change the presentation of HTML documents
Separate presentation from content

## Levels of CSS
- **External Style Sheet**: Specify the appearance of a single tag
- **External Style Sheets**: Apply to the document in which they appear
- **External Style Sheets**: Apply to any number of documents

External style sheets are written with the MIME type text/css

- `<div>` and `<span>` do nothing on their own. Designed as containers to attach CSS to.
- `<div>` - blocks of content
- `<span>` - inline content

## DOM
DOM = Document Object Model
- Essential for Dynamic HTML
- Allow scripts to identify and change elements of a webpage. Webpages are represented as a hierarchy
- Elements of documents are represented as objects that have methods
- HTML id attribute is used to identify unique elements

### Actions and Values
- DOM objects are specific instances of a tag
- Need to have a unique id to be addressable
- DOM values are the content of tags
- DOM methods are actions that you can perform on HTML elements

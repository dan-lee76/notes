So far seen how Haskell can be used to write batch programs.
Today, will see how to do interactive programs

Problem:
Haskell programs have no side effects
However interactive programs have side effects

Solution:
Can be written in Haskell by using types to distinguish pure expressions from impure actions that may involve side effects
`IO a` - returns the value of type a

## Basic Actions

`getChar`Adjugate - reads a character from the keyboard, echos it to the screen and returns the character as a result
`putChar c` - writes the character c to the screen and returns no result value
`return v` - returns the value v without performing any interaction

## Sequencing 
Sequence of actions can be combined as a single composite action using the keyword `do`

## Derived Primitives
`getLine` - reads an entire string. Haskell reads each character one by one, then returns it as a list. Need to have an action in the do block
`putStr` - Writes a string to the screen
`putStrLn` - Writes a string and moving to a new line

Evaluating an action executes its side effects, with the final result value being discarded

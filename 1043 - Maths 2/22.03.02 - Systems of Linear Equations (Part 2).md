# Rouch√®-Capelli Theorem
## Solutions for systems of linear equations
- *compatible* if it has at least one solution
- *determined* if it has only one solution
- *undetermined* if it has infinite solutions
- *incompatible* if it has no solutions. Has a split $A^c=A|b$

## Theorem
$Ax=b$ is compatible if and only if both the complete and incomplete matrices ($A|A^c$) are characterised by the same rank $\rho_A = \rho_{A^c}=\rho$ named rank of the system

### Cases
$\rho_a<\rho_{a^c}$ - Incompatible, no solutions
$\rho_a=\rho_{a^c}$ - system is compatible. Under these conditions, three cases can be identified:

1. $\rho_a=\rho_{a^c}=\rho=n=m$ - System is a Cramers system and can be solved Cramers method 
2. $\rho_a=\rho_{a^c}=\rho=n<m, \rho$ equations of the system  compose a Cramers system. The remaining $m-\rho$ are linear combination of the other, these equations are redundant and only 1 solution
3. $\rho_a=\rho_{a^c}=\rho\begin{cases}< n\\\le m\end{cases}$ is undetermined and has $\infty^{n-\rho}$

How to choose the equations to cancel?
- Cannot cancel any equations
- Need to ensure that the cancellation of an equation does not change the rank of the incomplete matrix $A$
- Have to cancel only linearly dependent equations, that is rows of the matrix $A^c$

## General Solutions of Undetermined Systems
- Select the $\rho$ rows linearly independent rows of the complete matrix $A^c$
- Choose (arbitrarily) $n-\rho$ variables and replace them with parameters
- Solve the system of linear equations with respect to the remaining variables
- Express the parametric vector as a sum of vectors, where each parameter appears in only one vector

# Homogeneous Systems of Linear Equations
Homogeneous if the vector of known terms $b$ is composed for only zeros and is indicated with O. Solution of at least null vector

## General solution of a system
If a solution of the homogeneous system then $\lambda$ is also a solution to the system

## Combination of solutions
If $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are both solutions then every linear combination of these two n-tuple is solution of the system.
$$\forall\lambda,\mu\in\R.(\lambda\alpha_1+\mu\beta_1,\lambda\alpha_2+\mu\beta_2,...,\lambda\alpha_n+\mu\beta_n)$$

## Special Property
Homogeneous system of $n$ equations in $n+1$ variables. System has $\infty^1$ solutions proportionate to the n-tuple

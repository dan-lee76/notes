# Systems of Linear Equations
Basically simultaneous equations. Can be written as $Ax=b$

The coefficient matrix $A$ is said *incomplete matrix*. The matrix  $A^c\in \R_{m,n+1}$ whose first $n$ columns are those of the matrix $A$ and the $(n+1^{th})$ column is the vector $b$ is said *complete matrix*

$$A^c=(A|b)=$$

# Cramer's Theorem
If $A$ is [non-singular](../1043%20-%20Maths%202/22.02.16%20-%20Determinants%20and%20Matrix%20Inversion-2.md#inverting-a-matrix) , the is only one solution simultaneously satisfying all the equations:
if $detA\ne 0$ then $\exist!x$ such that $Ax=b$

## Hybrid Matrix 
Hybrid matrix with respect to the $i^{th}$ column is the matrix $A_i$ obtained from $A$ by substituting the $i^{th}$ column with $b$
(Switch $a^i$ with $b$)

## Cramer's Method
For a given system of linear equations $Ax=b$ with $A$ non-singular, a generic solution $x_i$ element of $x$ can be computed as 
$$x_i=\frac{detA_i}{detA}$$

For a square matrices would repeat 3 times, change column 3 times with $b$

Bosh! I did a thing. After applying to over 10 placements I final got the one I wanted. [Capital One](https://capitalone.co.uk) based in Nottingham. This means I can still see my friends, live with them, and attend the lovely RamSoc and [HackSoc](https://hacksoc.net). How did I get this you ask? By successfully presenting [OnlyDans](https://onlydans.uk) to my line manager. Yes, you're reading that correct, that meme of a site I created, which is based on [OnlyFans](https://onlyfans.com). I'm very grateful of the outcome, and will be looking forawd to working there this June. This sadly means I wont have a summer ðŸ™ƒ but I'll have one the following year, so nevermind.

Here's a lovely meme I cretated

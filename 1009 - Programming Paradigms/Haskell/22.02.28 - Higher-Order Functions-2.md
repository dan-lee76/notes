A function is Higher-Order if it takes a function as an argument or returns a function as a result


## Why are they useful
- **Common programming idioms** can be encoded as functions within the language itself
- **Domain Specific Languages** can be defined as collections of higher-order functions
- **Algebraic Properties** of higher-order functions can be used to reason about programs

`twice` - calls a function twice
`map` - applies a function to every item in a list
`filter` - Selects every element from a list that satisfies a predicate

## Foldr Function
Number of functions on lists can be defined using the following simple pattern of recursion (primitive recursion):
```haskell
f [] = v
f (x:xs) = x ? f xs
```

F maps the empty list to some value v, and any non-empty list to some function ? applied to its head and f of its tail. 

`foldr` (fold right) - encapsulates this simple pattern of recursion with the function ? and the value v as arguments. Takes care of all the recursion. 
``` haskell
foldr :: (a -> b -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b
foldr f v [] = v
foldr f v (x:xs) = f x (foldr f v xs)
```

f is the function, v is return statement, and [] is the list

Think foldr **non-recursively**, as simultaneously replacing each (:) in a list by a given function, and [] by a given value

Can be used to define many more functions than might first be expected

Foldr  - Is building a function that does the matching and the recursion 

### Why its Useful
- Some recursive functions on list, such as sum, are simpler to define using foldr.
- Properties of functions defined using foldr can be proved using algebraic properties of foldr, such as fusion and the banana split rule
- Advanced program optimisations can be simplest if foldr is used in place of explicit recursion

## Other Library Functions
`.` returns the composition of two functions as a single function
Function composition simple way of cascading or one function after another
`all` decides if every element of a list satisfies a given predicate
`any` decides if at least one element of a list satisfies a predicate
`takeWhile` selects elements from a list while a predicate holds of all the elements
`dropWhile` removes elements while a predicate holds of all the elements

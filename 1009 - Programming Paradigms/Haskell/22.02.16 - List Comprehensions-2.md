 ## Set Comprehensions
 Comprehension notation can be used to construct new sets from old sets
 ${x^2 | x \in {1..5}}$
 
 In haskell can be done with list comprehension
 ```haskell
 [x^2 | x <- [1..5]]
 ```
 
- The expression `x <- [1..5]` is a generator, states how to generate values for x. Can be used multiple times separated by commas.
- Changing the order of the generators changes the order of the elements in the final list.
- Multiple generators are like nested loops, with later generators being more deeply nested loops

## Dependant generators
Later generators can depend on the variables that are introduced by earlier generators 
Using a dependent generator we can define the library function that concatenates a lists of lists

## Guards
Use guards to restrict the values produced by earlier generators
`[x | x <- [1..10], even x]` 
Using a guard we can define a function that maps a positive integer to its list of factors

## The zip function
```haskell
zip :: [a] -> [b] -> [(a,b)]
```
- Maps two lists to a lists of pairs of their corresponding elements.
- Define a function that returns the list of app pairs of adjacent elements from a list 
- Using pairs can define a function that decides if the elements in a list are sorted
- Using zip can define a function that returns the list of all positions of a value in a list

## String Comprehensions- 
- A string is a sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes. Internally, strings are represented as a lists of characters. 
- Any polymorphic function that operates on lists can also be applied to strings
- List comprehensions can also work them

Can use inheritance/sub type polymorphism for re-use and adaptation
Inheritance is one of the most important ideas in the object oriented paradigm. - Underpins many other things

# Inheritance: Sub-classing
Inheritance: IS-A relationships. 
- A class can be a specialisation of another class
- Use `extends` to get inheritance. *bear* 'IS-AN' *Animal*, so it gets everything in *Animal* and can change it or add to it

## Polymorphism
Means many forms - not fixed to specific types

### Parametric Polymorphism:
Code works with multiple types, or regardless of types
- What functional programmers mean
- Java generics

### Ad-hoc polymorphism (function overloading)
- Same function name, multiple versions differing by parameter types
- Function may work differently depending upon the type

### Sub-type polymorphism (sub classing)
- Usually what is meant by polymorphism in OO terms
- Often called inheritance or sub-classing
- Super-class/base class = Original class
- Sub-class/derived class = New type

# Public, Private, Protected
- `private` - Only this class can access this
- `nothing`(package) - This class + this package can access this
- `protected` - The class + this package + sub-classes can access this
- `public` - Anything can access this

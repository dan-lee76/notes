## Threads and main()
When window created, a thread will be started, but main() thread will still be running

## Example: JLabel
Can use the sub-class object as if it was the super-class. Then overwrite sections, similar to a theme. Such as font etc.
Can only call immediate super class

### ColorLabel
Has three attributes:
1. Colour to draw
2. Width of the border
3. Colour to draw the border

`this` - call another instructor of itself

## Example Layout Managers
### JPanel Components
Container for other components.
Can build up a user interface by putting JPanels inside JPanels

### Component Size
- `pack()` resizes the frame to fit the contents
- When you resize the frame, sometimes components will resize to fit in
- Can set, min, max, preferred
- Layout manager should not make them smaller than min or larger than max
- When working out what size, will use preferred size
- When multiple sizes are possiblejop preferred with be 'preferred'

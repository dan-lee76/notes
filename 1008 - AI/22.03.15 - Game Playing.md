# Game Playing
## Minimax
An opponent tried to prevent your win at every move
1944 - John von Neumann
- A search method, maximise your position whilst minimising your opponents

**Utility Function**: in order to implement we need a method of measuring how good a position is

Nim - Start with a pile of tokens, at each move the player must divide the tokens into two non-empty, non-equal piles.

- Efficiency of the search. Game trees are very big. Evaluation of positions is time-consuming
- To reduce the number of nodes to be evaluated can explore: Alpha-beta search based on minimax. Better estimate of utility values

Minmax uses BFS
# Alpha Beta Pruning
Is about reducing the size of the search tree

- Cannot prune nodes if doing BFS. Form of pruning relies on doing a DFS
- To maximise pruning: first expand the best children. Cannot know which ones are really best. Use heuristics for the 'best-first' ordering
- alpha $\alpha$: values are stored with each MAX node
- beta $\beta$: values are stored with each MIN node

# Introduction

## What is AI?

- Coined in 1956: "The sceicne and engineering of making intelligent machines"
- A branch of computer science and engineering that deals wiht intellegient behaviour, learning and adapatation in machines
- Create a computer mind that cna think like a human
- Intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed ot natural intelligence displayed by animals including humans

## Game playing

Alpha Go - Made decisions on the go, and was able to beat proffesional human

- Go player. Knowledge "learned" by ANN: deep learning
- Tree search
    May 11th 1997 - Beat game of chess against world championen

### Why study AI?

Games are intelligent activities
It is very easy to measure success or failure
Do not require large amounts of knowledge
Solvable by straightforward search from the starting state to a winning position, Tree search
